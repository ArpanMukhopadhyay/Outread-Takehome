Recent advances in ammonia synthesis technologies: Toward future zero carbon emissions,"As a carbon-free molecule, ammonia has gained great global interest in being considered a signiﬁcant future candidate for the transition toward renewable energy. Numerous appli- cations of ammonia as a fuel have been developed for energy generation, heavy trans- portation, and clean, distributed energy storage. There is a clear global target to achieve a sustainable economy and carbon neutrality. Therefore, most of the research's efforts are concentrated on generating cost-effective renewable energy on a large scale rather than fossil fuels. However, storage and transportation are still roadblocks for these technologies, for example, hydrogen technologies. Ammonia could be replaced as a viable fuel for a clean and sustainable future of global energy. More efforts from governments and scientists can lead to making ammonia a clean energy vector in most energy applications. In this review, ammonia synthesis was assessed, including conventional HabereBosch technology. Current hydrogen technologies as the key parameters for ammonia generation are also evaluated. The role of ammonia as a hydrogen-based fuel and generation roadmap are discussed for future utilization of energy mix. Further, ammonia generation processes are addressed in depth, including blue and green ammonia generation. A survey of ammonia synthesis cat- alytic materials was conducted and the role of catalyst materials in ammonia generation was compared, which showed that the Ru-based catalyst generated the maximum ammonia after 20 h of starting experiment. An end-use plan for using ammonia as a clean energy fuel in vehicles, marines, gas turbines as well as fuel cells, is brieﬂy discussed to recognize the potential applications of ammonia use. The practical and future end-use vision of energy sources is proposed to achieve great beneﬁts at low carbon emissions and costs. This review can provide prospective knowledge of large-scale aspects and environmental considerations of ammonia. Herein, we conclude that ammonia will become the “clean energy carrier link” that will achieve the global energy and economy sustainability targets.",carbon free molecul ammonia gain great global interest consid signiﬁc futur candid transit toward renew energi numer appli cation ammonia fuel develop energi gener heavi tran portat clean distribut energi storag clear global target achiev sustain economi carbon neutral therefor research effort concentr gener cost effect renew energi larg scale rather fossil fuel howev storag transport still roadblock technolog exampl hydrogen technolog ammonia could replac viabl fuel clean sustain futur global energi effort govern scientist lead make ammonia clean energi vector energi applic review ammonia synthesi assess includ convent haberebosch technolog current hydrogen technolog key paramet ammonia gener also evalu role ammonia hydrogen base fuel gener roadmap discuss futur util energi mix ammonia gener process address depth includ blue green ammonia gener survey ammonia synthesi cat alyt materi conduct role catalyst materi ammonia gener compar show ru base catalyst gener maximum ammonia h start experi end use plan use ammonia clean energi fuel vehicl marin ga turbin well fuel cell brieﬂi discuss recogn potenti applic ammonia use practic futur end use vision energi sourc propos achiev great beneﬁt low carbon emiss cost review provid prospect knowledg larg scale aspect environment consider ammonia herein conclud ammonia becom clean energi carrier link achiev global energi economi sustain target,2
Co doping regulating electronic structure of Bi2MoO6 to construct dual active sites for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation,"Although photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) is a green ammonia synthesis technology, it still encounters low adsorption/activation efficiency of N2 and lack of reaction active sites. Element doping is an efficient strategy to regulate electronic structure of catalyst. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the effect of doping elements on the N2 adsorption/activation, reaction active site and energy barriers is not well unraveled. Taking Co doped Bi2MoO6 (Co-Bi2MoO6) as a model photocatalyst, density functional theory (DFT) and experiment study were used to investigate the mechanism of Co doping on the PNRR performance over Bi2MoO6. DFT results reveal that Co doping regulates the electronic structure, activates Bi sites of Co-Bi2MoO6 and provides new Co active sites, thus constructing dual active sites for PNRR. Benefited from dual active sites for effectively adsorption/activation N2, the as-fabricated 3% Co-Bi2MoO6 exhibit the maximum NH3 generation rate of 95.5 μmol⋅g−1⋅h−1 without sacrificial agents, which is 7.2 times that of Bi2MoO6. Furthermore, the detail mechanism of N– – –N bond adsorption/activation and hydrogenation reaction on Co-Bi2MoO6 was also proposed according to in-situ FTIR and DFT results. This study provides a promising strategy to design catalysts with dual active sites for PNRR, which is of great significance to the popularization of other material systems.",although photocatalyt nitrogen reduct reaction pnrr green ammonia synthesi technolog still encount low adsorpt activ effici n2 lack reaction activ site element dope effici strategi regul electron structur catalyst nevertheless mechan effect dope element n2 adsorpt activ reaction activ site energi barrier well unravel take co dope bi2moo6 co bi2moo6 model photocatalyst densiti function theori dft experi studi use investig mechan co dope pnrr perform bi2moo6 dft result reveal co dope regul electron structur activ bi site co bi2moo6 provid new co activ site thu construct dual activ site pnrr benefit dual activ site effect adsorpt activ n2 fabric co bi2moo6 exhibit maximum nh3 gener rate μmolgh without sacrifici agent time bi2moo6 furthermor detail mechan n n bond adsorpt activ hydrogen reaction co bi2moo6 also propos accord situ ftir dft result studi provid promis strategi design catalyst dual activ site pnrr great signific popular materi system,1
"A Prompt Decarbonization Pathway for Shipping: Green Hydrogen, Ammonia, and Methanol Production and Utilization in Marine Engines",": The shipping industry has reached a higher level of maturity in terms of its knowledge and awareness of decarbonization challenges. Carbon-free or carbon-neutralized green fuel, such as green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol, are being widely discussed. However, little attention has paid to the green fuel pathway from renewable energy to shipping. This paper, therefore, provides a review of the production methods for green power (green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol) and analyzes the potential of green fuel for application to shipping. The review shows that the potential production methods for green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol for the shipping industry are (1) hydrogen production from seawater electrolysis using green power; (2) ammonia production from green hydrogen + Haber–Bosch process; and (3) methanol production from CO2 using green power. While the future of green fuel is bright, in the short term, the costs are expected to be higher than conventional fuel. Our recommendations are therefore as follows: improve green power production technology to reduce the production cost; develop electrochemical fuel production technology to increase the efﬁciency of green fuel production; and explore new technology. Strengthening the research and development of renewable energy and green fuel production technology and expanding fuel production capacity to ensure an adequate supply of low- and zero-emission marine fuel are important factors to achieve carbon reduction in shipping.

Utilization of green ammonia as a hydrogen energy carrier for decarbonization in spark ignition engines,"Rising concerns about the dependence of modern energy systems on fossil fuels have raised the requirement for green alternate fuels to pave the roadmap for a sustainable energy future with a carbon-free economy. Massive expectations of hydrogen as an enabler for decarbonization of the energy sector are limited by the lack of required infrastructure, whose implementation is affected by the issues related to the storage and distribution of hydrogen energy. Ammonia is an effective hydrogen energy carrier with a well-established and mature infrastructure for long-distance transportation and distribution. The possi- bility for green ammonia production from renewable energy sources has made it a suitable green alternate fuel for the decarbonization of the automotive and power generation sectors. In this work, engine characteristics for ammonia combustion in spark ignition engines have been reported with a detailed note on engines fuelled with pure ammonia as well as blends of ammonia with gasoline, hydrogen, and methane. Higher auto-ignition temperature, low ﬂammability, and lower ﬂame speed of ammonia have a detrimental effect on engine characteristics, and it could be addressed either by incorporating engine modiﬁcations or by enhancing the fuel quality. Literature shows that the increase in compression ratio from 9.4:1 to 11.5:1 improved the maximum power by 59% and the addition of 10% hydrogen in supercharged conditions improved the indicated efﬁciency by 37%. Challenges and strategies for the utilization of ammonia as combustible fuel in en- gines are discussed by considering the need for technical advancements as well as social acceptance. Energy efﬁciency for green ammonia production is also discussed with a due note on techniques for direct synthesis of ammonia from air and water.",rise concern depend modern energi system fossil fuel rais requir green altern fuel pave roadmap sustain energi futur carbon free economi massiv expect hydrogen enabl decarbon energi sector limit lack requir infrastructur whose implement affect issu relat storag distribut hydrogen energi ammonia effect hydrogen energi carrier well establish matur infrastructur long distanc transport distribut possi biliti green ammonia product renew energi sourc made suitabl green altern fuel decarbon automot power gener sector work engin characterist ammonia combust spark ignit engin report detail note engin fuell pure ammonia well blend ammonia gasolin hydrogen methan higher auto ignit temperatur low ﬂammabl lower ﬂame speed ammonia detriment effect engin characterist could address either incorpor engin modiﬁc enhanc fuel qualiti literatur show increas compress ratio improv maximum power addit hydrogen supercharg condit improv indic efﬁcienc challeng strategi util ammonia combust fuel en gine discuss consid need technic advanc well social accept energi efﬁcienc green ammonia product also discuss due note techniqu direct synthesi ammonia air water,2
Techno-economic assessment of green hydrogen and ammonia production from wind and solar energy in Iran,"Green ammonia Green hydrogen Seawater desalination a b s t r a c t This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potential green hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strong wind and solar resources. The study was organized in ﬁve steps. First, regarding the wind density and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. All these lo- cations are inland spots, but since the produced ammonia is planned to be exported, it must be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen pro- duction facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber- Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis re- quires a considerable amount of water with speciﬁc quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this re- gard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study in- tends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, hydrogen, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using",green ammonia green hydrogen seawat desalin b r c paper present comprehens technic econom assess potenti green hydrogen ammonia product plant differ locat iran strong wind solar resourc studi organ ﬁve step first regard wind densiti solar pv potenti data three locat iran chosen highest wind power solar radiat combin wind solar energi lo cation inland spot sinc produc ammonia plan export must transport export harbor south iran comparison base case also consid next export harbor normal solar wind potenti distanc export harbor second step similar larg scale hydrogen pro duction facil proton exchang membran electrolyz model locat use homer pro simul platform next step produc hydrogen nitrogen obtain air separ unit suppli haber bosch process synthes ammonia hydrogen carrier sinc water electrolysi quir consider amount water speciﬁc qualiti iran suffer water scarciti paper unlik mani similar research studi address challeng associ water suppli system hydrogen product process gard fourth step studi assum seawat nearest sea treat desalin plant sent site locat final sinc studi tend evalu possibl green hydrogen export iran detail pipe model transport water hydrogen ammonia product site export harbor creat last step consid real rout use,2
Estimating global production and supply costs for green hydrogen and hydrogen-based green energy commodities,"Green energy commodities are expected to be central in decarbonising the global energy system. Such green energy commodities could be hydrogen or other hydrogen-based en- ergy commodities produced from renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar or wind energy. We quantify the production cost and potentials of hydrogen and hydrogen-based energy commodities ammonia, methane, methanol, gasoline, diesel and kerosene in 113 countries. Moreover, we evaluate total supply costs to Germany, considering both pipeline- based and maritime transport. We determine production costs by optimising the invest- ment and operation of commodity production from dedicated RES based on country-level RES potentials and country-speciﬁc weighted average costs of capital. Analysing the geographic distribution of production and supply costs, we ﬁnd that production costs dominate the supply cost composition for liquid or easily liqueﬁable commodities, while transport costs dominate for gaseous commodities. In the case of Germany, importing green ammonia could be more cost-efﬁcient than domestic production from locally pro- duced or imported hydrogen. Green ammonia could be supplied to Germany from many regions worldwide at below the cost of domestic production, with costs ranging from 624 to 874 $/t NH3 and Norway being the cheapest supplier. Ammonia production using imported hydrogen from Spain could be cost-effective if a pan-European hydrogen pipeline grid based on repurposed natural gas pipelines exists.",green energi commod expect central decarbonis global energi system green energi commod could hydrogen hydrogen base en ergi commod produc renew energi sourc re solar wind energi quantifi product cost potenti hydrogen hydrogen base energi commod ammonia methan methanol gasolin diesel kerosen countri moreov evalu total suppli cost germani consid pipelin base maritim transport determin product cost optimis invest ment oper commod product dedic re base countri level re potenti countri speciﬁc weight averag cost capit analys geograph distribut product suppli cost ﬁnd product cost domin suppli cost composit liquid easili liqueﬁ commod transport cost domin gaseou commod case germani import green ammonia could cost efﬁcient domest product local pro duce import hydrogen green ammonia could suppli germani mani region worldwid cost domest product cost rang nh3 norway cheapest supplier ammonia product use import hydrogen spain could cost effect pan european hydrogen pipelin grid base repurpos natur ga pipelin exist,2
"A Perspective on the Overarching Role of Hydrogen, Ammonia, and Methanol Carbon-Neutral Fuels towards Net Zero Emission in the Next Three Decades",": Arguably, one of the most important issues the world is facing currently is climate change. At the current rate of fossil fuel consumption, the world is heading towards extreme levels of global temperature rise if immediate actions are not taken. Transforming the current energy system from one largely based on fossil fuels to a carbon-neutral one requires unprecedented speed. Based on the current state of development, direct electriﬁcation of the future energy system alone is technically challenging and not enough, especially in hard-to-abate sectors like heavy industry, road trucking, international shipping, and aviation. This leaves a considerable demand for alternative carbon-neutral fuels such as green ammonia and hydrogen and renewable methanol. From this perspective, we discuss the overarching roles of each fuel in reaching net zero emission within the next three decades. The challenges and future directions associated with the fuels conclude the current perspective paper.

The economics of global green ammonia trade - Shipping Australian wind and sunshine to Germany,"This paper contributes to understanding the transformation of global energy trade to green energy carriers, focusing on green ammonia as the foreseeable first green hydrogen carrier. We provide a comprehensive over­ view of today’s ammonia trade and assess scaling options for the trade of green ammonia. To that aim, we develop an optimization model for the integrated assessment of the green ammonia value chain that covers all steps from green ammonia production in an exporting country, up to delivery to a harbor in an importing country. The model endogenously chooses among different technology options and determines cost minimal operation. In a case study, we apply the model to the large-scale import of ammonia from Australia to Germany in a scenario for 2030. The results show that green ammonia can reach cost parity with gray ammonia even for moderate gas prices (but not necessarily with blue ammonia) if CO2 prices are high enough. We also provide a sensitivity analysis with respect to the interest rate and other key technical and economic parameters and show that cracking ammonia to provide pure hydrogen comes at a 45 % cost markup per MWh at the destination.",paper contribut understand transform global energi trade green energi carrier focus green ammonia forese first green hydrogen carrier provid comprehens view today ammonia trade ass scale option trade green ammonia aim develop optim model integr assess green ammonia valu chain cover step green ammonia product export countri deliveri harbor import countri model endogen choos among differ technolog option determin cost minim oper case studi appli model larg scale import ammonia australia germani scenario 2030 result show green ammonia reach cost pariti gray ammonia even moder ga price necessarili blue ammonia co2 price high enough also provid sensit analysi respect interest rate key technic econom paramet show crack ammonia provid pure hydrogen come cost markup per mwh destin,2
Techno-economic evaluation of hydrogen and ammonia as energy carriers in a multi-generation system,"Green hydrogen is suitable for grid-scale energy storage to increase the penetration of renewable energy, and it is also an alternative to fossil fuels. However, it still suffers from storage problems owing to its low volumetric energy density, embrittlement, and very low boiling point. To improve safety and reduce cost, green ammonia has been proposed as a substitute for hydrogen and has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a multi- generation system was proposed to compare green hydrogen and green ammonia as energy carriers. Four sce­ narios are discussed and the performances under different energy carriers, constant and time-of-use electricity prices, and on-grid and off-grid operations are compared. The optimal planning of the system was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and was evaluated using supply and demand profiles hourly over a year. The objective was to maximize profitability, which is reflected by the cumulative cash position and payback period. The results revealed that the hydrogen-based system was superior to the ammonia-based system. In the hydrogen-based scenario, the cumulative cash position was 83.43 MUSD and the payback period was 14 years. The cumulative cash position and payback period were 12.78 MUSD and 22 years, respectively, in the ammonia- based scenario. To improve profitability, it is recommended to increase the capacity for hydrogen/ammonia production and reduce the capacity for backup power generation.",green hydrogen suitabl grid scale energi storag increas penetr renew energi also altern fossil fuel howev still suffer storag problem owe low volumetr energi densiti embrittl low boil point improv safeti reduc cost green ammonia propos substitut hydrogen attract consider attent studi multi gener system propos compar green hydrogen green ammonia energi carrier four sce nario discuss perform differ energi carrier constant time use electr price grid grid oper compar optim plan system formul mix integ linear program problem evalu use suppli demand profil hourli year object maxim profit reflect cumul cash posit payback period result reveal hydrogen base system superior ammonia base system hydrogen base scenario cumul cash posit musd payback period year cumul cash posit payback period musd year respect ammonia base scenario improv profit recommend increas capac hydrogen ammonia product reduc capac backup power gener,2
Potential-Driven Restructuring of Cu Single Atoms to Nanoparticles for Boosting the Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia,": Restructuring is ubiquitous in thermocatalysis and of pivotal importance to identify the real active site, yet it is less explored in electrocatalysis. Herein, by using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy in conjunction with advanced electron microscopy, we reveal the restructuring of the as-synthesized Cu− N4 single-atom site to the nanoparticles of ∼5 nm during the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia, a green ammonia production route upon combined with the plasma-assisted oxidation of nitrogen. The reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ and Cu0 and the subsequent aggregation of Cu0 single atoms is found to occur concurrently with the enhancement of the NH3 production rate, both of them are driven by the applied potential switching from 0.00 to −1.00 V versus RHE. The maximum production rate of ammonia reaches 4.5 mg cm−2 h−1 (12.5 molNH3 gCu −1 h−1) with a Faradaic eﬃciency of 84.7% at −1.00 V versus RHE, outperforming most of the other Cu catalysts reported previously. After electrolysis, the aggregated Cu nanoparticles are reversibly disintegrated into single atoms and then restored to the Cu−N4 structure upon being exposed to an ambient atmosphere, which masks the potential-induced restructuring during the reaction. The synchronous changes of the Cu0 percentage and the ammonia Faradaic eﬃciency with the applied potential suggests that the Cu nanoparticles are the genuine active sites for nitrate reduction to ammonia, which is corroborated with both the post-deposited Cu NP catalyst and density functional theory calculations. ■",restructur ubiquit thermocatalysi pivot import identifi real activ site yet le explor electrocatalysi herein use operando x ray absorpt spectroscopi conjunct advanc electron microscopi reveal restructur synthes cu n4 singl atom site nanoparticl nm electrochem reduct nitrat ammonia green ammonia product rout upon combin plasma assist oxid nitrogen reduct cu2 cu cu0 subsequ aggreg cu0 singl atom found occur concurr enhanc nh3 product rate driven appli potenti switch v versu rhe maximum product rate ammonia reach mg cm h molnh3 gcu h farada eﬃcienc v versu rhe outperform cu catalyst report previous electrolysi aggreg cu nanoparticl revers disintegr singl atom restor cun4 structur upon expos ambient atmospher mask potenti induc restructur reaction synchron chang cu0 percentag ammonia farada eﬃcienc appli potenti suggest cu nanoparticl genuin activ site nitrat reduct ammonia corrobor post deposit cu np catalyst densiti function theori calcul,1
Sodium-Ion Battery Materials and Electrochemical Properties Reviewed,"graphite as a cheap, elec- trochemically active and high-capacity anode in LIB, and the failure of sodium insertion in graphite, resulted in the near abandonment of the research in Na intercalation materials for SIB application.[17] A decade later, in the year 2000, Stevens and Dahn[18] reported the successful electrochemical insertion of sodium in hard carbon (HC), at a specific capacity close to that of lithium in graphite (≈372 mAh g−1). This discovery, coupled with a growing need of a complementary technology to the LIB became a major turning point in the rejuvenated interest in the SIB concept. Since this discovery, the SIBs have increasingly gained trac- tion, buoyed by further discoveries in anodic and cathodic materials. Much of this rapid progress in material development is attributed to the similarities between SIBs and LIBs. Funda- mentally, the voltage range and operating principles of the SIBs and LIBs are identical. This similarity has allowed the years of conceptual understanding and development in LIBs to be directly transferred, thereby allowing a rapid growth in the SIB technology. Besides borrowing from material synthesis routes, the same production lines used to manufacture LIB cells can be used to make SIB cells without any modification.[19] Several companies such as Faradion (UK)[20] and Sumitomo[21] (Japan) have thus announced plans to commercialize SIBs, the latter having initially disclosed plans to start mass production as early as 2016.[22] Although SIBs are not projected to compete with LIBs for volumetric and gravimetric energy density, they are expected to leverage their resource abundance to be price competitive and Kudakwashe Chayambuka is a researcher at Energy Technology unit (ETE) of the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO) and is Ph.D. candidate at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e) Faculty of Electrical Engineering. He focuses on the electrochem- ical modeling of sodium-ion batteries and other energy storage systems such as Li-ion and NiMH batteries using MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics. Grietus Mulder is researcher at the Flemish Technological Institute VITO in the unit Energy Technology with a background in applied physics. He specializes in the field of electrical energy storage for automotive and renewable energy applications. He developed battery testing methods and software mar- keted as “BATAL,” used for automotive applications like plugin hybrid vehicles and also for the integration of photovoltaic energy in a smart grid network. He also works on electrochemical modeling of bat- teries with the help of the COMSOL Multiphysics software. Peter H. L. Notten joined Philips Research Laboratories (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) from 1975 to 2010. He received his Ph.D. degree from Eindhoven University in 1989. Since then he focused on energy storage research, including hydrogen and lithium storage materials, new battery technologies, mod eling electrochemical systems, and design of battery-management algorithms. In 2000 he was appointed as professor at TU/e where he now heads the group Energy Materials and Devices. In 2014 he has been appointed as International Adjunct Faculty at Amrita University, Coimbatore (India), as group leader at Forschungszentrum Ju ˝lich (Germany), and in 2018 as honorary professor at University of Technology Sydney. therefore complement LIBs in stationary and large-scale appli- cations. This is further expected to stabilize the costs of lithium- based batteries as they enter the mass market of electric vehicles by suppressing Li, Co, and Cu resource constraints. In this Adv.

Rechargeable Zinc Alkaline Anodes for Long-Cycle Energy Storage,": Zinc alkaline anodes command signiﬁcant share of consumer battery markets and are a key technology for the emerging grid-scale battery market. Improved understanding of this electrode is required for long-cycle deployments at kWh and MWh scale due to strict requirements on performance, cost, and safety. Here we give a modern literature survey of zinc alkaline anodes with levelized performance metrics and also present an experimental assessment of leading formulations. Long-cycle materials characterization, performance metrics, and failure analysis are reported for over 25 unique anode formulations with up to 1500 cycles and ∼1.5 years of shelf life per test. Statistical repeatability of these measurements is made for a baseline design (fewest additives) via 15 duplicates. Baseline design capacity density is 38 mAh per mL of anode volume, and lifetime throughput is 72 Ah per mL of anode volume. We then report identical measurements for anodes with improved material properties via additives and other perturbations, some of which achieve capacity density over 192 mAh per mL of anode volume and lifetime throughput of 190 Ah per mL of anode volume. Novel in operando X-ray microscopy of a cycling zinc paste anode reveals the formation of a nanoscale zinc material that cycles electrochemically and replaces the original anode structure over long-cycle life. Ex situ elemental mapping and other materials characterization suggest that the key physical processes are hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), growth of zinc oxide nanoscale material, concentration deﬁcits of OH−and ZnOH4 2−, and electrodeposition of Zn growths outside and through separator membranes. ■",zinc alkalin anod command signiﬁc share consum batteri market key technolog emerg grid scale batteri market improv understand electrod requir long cycl deploy kwh mwh scale due strict requir perform cost safeti give modern literatur survey zinc alkalin anod level perform metric also present experiment assess lead formul long cycl materi character perform metric failur analysi report uniqu anod formul 1500 cycl year shelf life per test statist repeat measur made baselin design fewest addit via duplic baselin design capac densiti mah per ml anod volum lifetim throughput ah per ml anod volum report ident measur anod improv materi properti via addit perturb achiev capac densiti mah per ml anod volum lifetim throughput ah per ml anod volum novel operando x ray microscopi cycl zinc past anod reveal format nanoscal zinc materi cycl electrochem replac origin anod structur long cycl life ex situ element map materi character suggest key physic process hydrogen evolut reaction growth zinc oxid nanoscal materi concentr deﬁcit ohand znoh4 electrodeposit zn growth outsid separ membran,1
Stochastic coordinated operation of wind and battery energy storage system considering battery degradation,"In contemporary times, emerging economies are intended to achieve higher economic growth via foreign direct investment and technological innovation. However, due to increased environmental challenges, these economies are adopting green energy as the key source of environmental recovery and net zero emissions. The present study investigates the influence of FDI, technological innovation, green energy, and trade on carbon emissions in BRICS economies during 1990–2022. This study also considers the role of economic expansion in identifying the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Using several panel diagnostic and cointegration tests, this study validates the slope heterogeneity and the existence of the cointegration between variables. Due to the non-normal data dispersion, this study uses novel moments quantile regression, while bootstrap quantile regression is used for the robustness. The results examined asserted the presence of the EKC hypothesis in the region, where the initial growth enhances emissions while after reaching at a threshold level, the emission level tends to reduce and environmental quality improves. Besides, this study observed that foreign trade and technological innovation are the key drivers of environmental degradation as these indicators significantly enhances pollution emissions. In contrast, foreign investment, energy efficiency, renewable electricity output, and renewable’s consumption signifi­ cantly improve environmental quality by declining carbon emissions. Following the empirical results, the policy recommendations asserted enhanced investment in renew­ able and energy efficiency sectors while attracting more foreign investment for sustain­ able development.

Polyanion-type electrode materials for advanced sodium-ion batteries,"Electrical energy storage (EES) exploiting secondary battery technologies is ideal for large-scale energy storage needs due to the rapid growth in proliferation of renewable energy sources and the emerging markets of grid-scale battery applications. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), a more sustainable EES option alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), have attracted intensive interests over the past decade, because of the natural abundance, evenly geographical-distributed Na-source, signiﬁcantly low cost, and environmental benignity. Polyanionic compounds offer an appealing combination of rich structural di- versity, superior ionic conductivity, high structural and thermal stability, and convenient storage/ handling, making them competitive and attractive candidate electrode materials for next generation energy storage systems. In this review, recent advancements made regarding polyanion-type electrodes used for SIBs are summarized, elaborating their intrinsic structural characteristics, electrochemical properties, and corresponding sodium-storage mechanisms. Furthermore, we highlight the recent achievements in the lab-scale Na-ion full-cell prototypes that consist of polyanion-type compounds as one or both working electrodes. Last but not least, challenges and outlooks on further optimization of the structure and the electrochemical performance of polyanion-type electrode materials for SIBs are also presented to provide some insights to facilitate the practical realization of sodium-ion technologies.",electr energi storag ee exploit secondari batteri technolog ideal larg scale energi storag need due rapid growth prolifer renew energi sourc emerg market grid scale batteri applic sodium ion batteri sib sustain ee option altern lithium ion batteri lib attract intens interest past decad natur abund evenli geograph distribut na sourc signiﬁcantli low cost environment benign polyanion compound offer appeal combin rich structur di versiti superior ionic conduct high structur thermal stabil conveni storag handl make competit attract candid electrod materi next gener energi storag system review recent advanc made regard polyanion type electrod use sib summar elabor intrins structur characterist electrochem properti correspond sodium storag mechan furthermor highlight recent achiev lab scale na ion full cell prototyp consist polyanion type compound one work electrod last least challeng outlook optim structur electrochem perform polyanion type electrod materi sib also present provid insight facilit practic realiz sodium ion technolog,0
Assessing new transmission and energy storage in achieving increasing renewable generation targets in a regional grid,"This study evaluates generation, transmission, and storage capacity needs to achieve deep renewable energy penetration in a regional electricity grid with an average load of approximately 20 GW. Increasing renewable energy targets are analyzed to evaluate the effects of realistic regional transmission upgrade and energy storage cost assumptions on the cost-optimal mix of generation, transmission, and storage capacity. Contextual data is used for New York State’s grid to examine how electricity generation from renewable energy resources (wind, water, and solar power) can meet between 50% and 80% of electricity demand. A central finding of the study is that when realistic transmission upgrade costs are assumed, new interzonal transmission and battery storage are not needed to cost effectively meet near-term renewable energy goals. In fact, New York can achieve 50% renewable energy penetration with only a buildout of new generation capacity: Onshore wind (13.7 GW), off- shore wind (4.1 GW), and solar photovoltaics (3 GW). The presence of grid-scale battery storage, electric ve- hicles, or additional behind-the-meter solar capacity does not markedly change the model-selected generation mix. To achieve the 50% target, we compute a $52/MWh levelized cost of electricity for new renewable energy, which is in line with current generation costs. As the renewable generation target increases beyond 50%, the model begins to select transmission upgrades and new storage capacity, the latter particularly if battery costs continue to decline as anticipated. At deeper targets, marginal generation capacity would otherwise experience high curtailment primarily due to supply–- demand imbalances; we calculate the value of energy storage at a 65% renewable energy penetration level to be 2.5–3 times higher than its value at a 50% level. However, the additional storage and generation – and trans- mission, to a lesser degree – needed to achieve longer-term renewable energy goals lead to a substantial rise in total investment. Between 50% and 55% targets, the computed marginal levelized cost of electricity for new variable renewable energy is $94/MWh, compared to $592/MWh between 75% and 80%, suggesting alternative integration measures are likely necessary at such high penetration rates.

Fiber Optic Sensing Technologies for Battery Management Systems and Energy Storage Applications,": Applications of ﬁber optic sensors to battery monitoring have been increasing due to the growing need of enhanced battery management systems with accurate state estimations. The goal of this review is to discuss the advancements enabling the practical implementation of battery internal parameter measurements including local temperature, strain, pressure, and refractive index for general operation, as well as the external measurements such as temperature gradients and vent gas sensing for thermal runaway imminent detection. A reasonable matching is discussed between ﬁber optic sensors of different range capabilities with battery systems of three levels of scales, namely electric vehicle and heavy-duty electric truck battery packs, and grid-scale battery systems. The advantages of ﬁber optic sensors over electrical sensors are discussed, while electrochemical stability issues of ﬁber-implanted batteries are critically assessed. This review also includes the estimated sensing system costs for typical ﬁber optic sensors and identiﬁes the high interrogation cost as one of the limitations in their practical deployment into batteries. Finally, future perspectives are considered in the implementation of ﬁber optics into high-value battery applications such as grid-scale energy storage fault detection and prediction systems.

Challenges and Mitigation Measures in Power Systems with High Share of Renewables-The Australian Experience,": Australia is one of the leading countries in energy transition, and its largest power system is intended to securely operate with up to 75% of variable renewable generation by 2025. High-inertia synchronous condensers, battery energy storage systems, and grid-forming converters are some of the technologies supporting this transformation while facilitating the secure operation of the grid. Synchronous condensers have enabled 2500 MW of solar and wind generation in the state of South Australia, reaching minimum operational demands of ≈100 MW. Grid-scale battery energy storage systems have demonstrated not only market beneﬁts by cutting costs to consumers but also essential grid services during contingencies. Fast frequency response, synthetic inertia, and high fault currents are some of the grid-supporting capabilities provided by new developments that strengthen the grid while facilitating the integration of new renewable energy hubs. This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview, based on the Australian experience, of how power systems are overcoming expected challenges while continuing to integrate secure, low cost, and clean energy.

State-of-Charge Balancing Control for ON/OFF-Line Internal Cells Using Hybrid Modular Multi-Level Converter and Parallel Modular Dual L-Bridge in a Grid-Scale Battery Energy Storage System,"Cell state-of-charge (SoC) balancing within a battery energy-storage system (BESS) is the key to optimizing capacity utilization of a BESS. Many cell SoC balancing strategies have been proposed; however, control complexity and slow SoC convergence remain as key issues. This paper presents two strategies to achieve SoC balancing among cells: main balancing strategy (MBS) using a cascaded hybrid modular multi-level converter (CHMMC) and a supplementary balancing strategy (SBS) using a cascaded parallel modular dual L-bridge (CPMDLB). The control and monitoring of individual cells with a reduction in the component count and the losses of BESS are achieved by integrating each individual cell into an L-bridge instead of an H-bridge. The simulation results demonstrate a satisfactory performance of the proposed SoC balancing strategy. In this result, SoC balancing convergence point for the cells/modules is achieved at 1000 min when cell-prioritized MBS-CHMMC works without SBS-CPMDLB and at 216.7 min when CPMBS-CHMMC works together with SBS-CPMDLB and when the duration required reduces by 78.33 %. Similarly, a substantial improvement in SoC balancing convergence point for the cells/modules is achieved when module-prioritized MBS-CHMMC works together with SBS-CPMDLB; the duration needed to reach the SoC balancing convergence point for the cells/modules is achieved after 333.3 and 183.3 min.

Investigating the role of nuclear power and battery storage in Hungary's energy transition using hourly resolution electricity market simulations,"Electricity supply in European countries faces a number of challenges, such as achieving carbon neutrality, tackling rising prices, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, including fossil fuel im­ ports. To achieve these goals, the electricity systems of all European countries will have to un­ dergo major changes, while taking into account technical, environmental, economic and social objectives. Our simulations provide essential data for this transition by analyzing different power plant portfolios and electricity consumption scenarios. The analyses focus on the cooperation of nuclear power and weather-dependent renewables, and on the possible role that battery-based electricity storage can play in the Hungarian electricity system. In this paper, we present the experience gained in setting up an electricity market model and the results of running the model on the electricity systems of Hungary and its six neighboring countries (Slovakia, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria), taking into account the constraints of the cross-border capacities. The results of the sensitivity analysis for the 2030 power plant portfolios, battery capacities and renewables analyzed in this paper cover Hungary’s import/export position, the energy source structure of its electricity generation, battery opera­ tion, CO2 emissions from electricity generation, expected prices in the system and the utilization parameters of nuclear power plants.",electr suppli european countri face number challeng achiev carbon neutral tackl rise price reduc depend fossil fuel includ fossil fuel im port achiev goal electr system european countri un dergo major chang take account technic environment econom social object simul provid essenti data transit analyz differ power plant portfolio electr consumpt scenario analysi focu cooper nuclear power weather depend renew possibl role batteri base electr storag play hungarian electr system paper present experi gain set electr market model result run model electr system hungari six neighbor countri slovakia romania serbia croatia slovenia austria take account constraint cross border capac result sensit analysi 2030 power plant portfolio batteri capac renew analyz paper cover hungari import export posit energi sourc structur electr gener batteri opera tion co2 emiss electr gener expect price system util paramet nuclear power plant,0
Using electrolytic hydrogen production and energy storage for balancing a low carbon electricity grid: Scenario assessments for India,"Nuclear reactors and variable renewables will play a significant role in the global energy transition as providers of low carbon electricity to various end use sectors. Real time balancing of power demand and supply without modulation or curtailment is possible using electrolytic hydrogen plants and energy storage systems. The gen­ eration mix adopted and load profiles are unique to a country and this study considers the specific case of India. This work analyses the use of grid connected water electrolysers, grid scale battery storage, hydrogen storage and fuel cells as flexible loads and dispatch schemes for grid balancing. Based on postulated long term power gen­ eration scenarios for India, the minimum required system sizes for grid balancing are estimated and techno- economic uncertainties are assessed. The use of water electrolysers is prioritized to make use of excess power, while minimizing battery storage requirement. This scheme can potentially produce a substantial share of low carbon hydrogen in India for use in industrial decarbonization, thus reducing the need for additional generation infrastructure.",nuclear reactor variabl renew play signific role global energi transit provid low carbon electr variou end use sector real time balanc power demand suppli without modul curtail possibl use electrolyt hydrogen plant energi storag system gen erat mix adopt load profil uniqu countri studi consid specif case india work analysi use grid connect water electrolys grid scale batteri storag hydrogen storag fuel cell flexibl load dispatch scheme grid balanc base postul long term power gen erat scenario india minimum requir system size grid balanc estim techno econom uncertainti assess use water electrolys priorit make use excess power minim batteri storag requir scheme potenti produc substanti share low carbon hydrogen india use industri decarbon thu reduc need addit gener infrastructur,0
"Impacts of grid-scale battery systems on power system operation, case of Baltic region","Grid stability can be affected by the large‐scale utilisation of renewable energy sources because there are fluctuations in generation and load. These issues can be effectively addressed by grid‐scale battery energy storage systems (BESS), which can respond quickly and provide high energy density. Different roles of grid‐scale BESS in power systems are addressed, following optimal operation approaches classification. Furthermore, inte- grating BESSs into distribution grids is discussed to manage challenges from distributed generation. BESSs aid in voltage control, enhance frequency regulation, and offer black‐ start services. Aggregating distributed BESSs can provide ancillary services and improve grid economics. For consumers, BESSs optimise energy costs, enhance reliability, and support self‐consumption from renewables. Novel BESS services include congestion relief, system adequacy, and power quality enhancement. Moreover, the ancillary services provided in different European countries through BESS are analysed. Finally, a case study was conducted among three Baltic DSOs to analyse the required amendments to Grid Codes and Electricity Market Acts for the integration of grid scale BESS. K E Y W O R D S energy storage, power distribution control 1 | ROLES OF GRID‐SCALE BESS IN POWER SYSTEMS Grid‐scale BESS can be utilised for many different purposes in electricity systems. At its core, BESS provides means to store electrical energy for later usage; large grid‐scale storage can have a substantial impact on grid performance. This energy could be used to improve the grid reliability and power quality by providing ancillary services such as frequency regulation. Additionally, BESS can provide virtual inertia, which will become especially relevant in future largely RES‐dominated grids. The stored energy can be used even out the daily po- wer curve by reducing the peak power. Furthermore, it can enable renewable integration in current grids and postpone grid reinforcement that will inevitably be needed. In this sec- tion these roles have been studied further. 1.1 | Grid reliability and power quality impact 1.1.1 | Ancillary service provision Ancillary services are supportive services that enable the transmission of electrical power from generation to con- sumption by ensuring that the grid parameters are kept in safe viable ranges. The term ancillary service can refer to a variety of different services but from the perspective of grid‐scale BESS what are interesting and what are currently widely be- ing researched are the frequency regulation, voltage regulation, and black start services.

Performance Evaluation Of Grid-scale Battery Energy Storage System Employing Virtual Synchronous Generator Control For Grid Code Compliance In Weak Grids,"—This document is on the design and testing of a grid- scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) employing Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) control grid-forming scheme. The BESS is rated 60 MWh/50 MW. The simulations were conducted using MATLAB/Simulink/Simscape software. The pro- tection functions and the associated protection relays needed to achieve these functionalities are presented. The approach adopted can apply to any relevant standard or grid code associated with a Transmission System Operator (TSO) internationally, however, the local grid codes in the context of South Africa were used. The system is designed to be compliant with the document Grid Connection Code for Battery Energy Storage Facilities (BESF) connected to the Electricity Transmission System (TS) or the Distribution System (DS) in South Africa and is classified under Category C as defined in the same document. The system was able to adjust both its active and reactive power outputs accordingly in response to load reduction conditions in the network. Furthermore, for local fault conditions, it was able to ride-through transient faults and trip and disconnect for permanent faults. For these two cases the BESS protection functionality serves as primary protection. The system was also able to trip and disconnect for remote permanent faults where the associated protection functionality is utilised as back-up protection.

Early prediction of battery degradation in grid-scale battery energy storage system using extreme gradient boosting algorithm,"The growth of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is caused by the variability and intermittent nature of high demand and renewable power generation at the network scale. In the context of BESS, Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery occupies a crucial position, although it is faced with challenges related to performance battery degra­ dation over time due to electrochemical processes. This battery degradation is a crucial factor to account for, based on its potential to diminish the efficiency and safety of electrical system equipment, thereby contributing to increased system planning costs. This implies that the health of battery needs to be diagnosed, particularly by determining remaining useful life (RUL), to avoid unexpected operational costs and ensure system safety. Therefore, this study aimed to use machine learning models, specifically extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, to estimate RUL, with a focus on the temperature variable, an aspect that had been previously underemphasized. Utilizing XGBoost model, along with fine-tuning its hyperparameters, proved to be a more accurate and efficient method for predicting RUL. The evaluation of the model yielded promising outcomes, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 90.1 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7.5 %. Additionally, the results showed that the model could improve RUL predictions for batteries within BESS. This study signif­ icantly contributed to optimizing planning and operations for BESS, as well as developing more efficient and effective maintenance strategies.",growth batteri energi storag system be caus variabl intermitt natur high demand renew power gener network scale context be lithium ion li ion batteri occupi crucial posit although face challeng relat perform batteri degra dation time due electrochem process batteri degrad crucial factor account base potenti diminish effici safeti electr system equip therebi contribut increas system plan cost impli health batteri need diagnos particularli determin remain use life rul avoid unexpect oper cost ensur system safeti therefor studi aim use machin learn model specif extrem gradient boost xgboost algorithm estim rul focu temperatur variabl aspect previous underemphas util xgboost model along fine tune hyperparamet prove accur effici method predict rul evalu model yield promis outcom root mean squar error rmse mean absolut percentag error mape addit result show model could improv rul predict batteri within be studi signif icantli contribut optim plan oper be well develop effici effect mainten strategi,0
Optimal day-ahead large-scale battery dispatch model for multi-regulation participation considering full timescale uncertainties,"Grid scale battery integration plays an important role in renewable energy integration and the formation of smart grid. To mitigate the problems of insufficient frequency response and peak regulation capacities faced by modern power grids with high wind energy uptake, a day-ahead optimization dispatch strategy considering operational risks is proposed in this study. In the day-ahead dispatch model, generation units and a large-scale battery energy storage station (LS-BESS) are coordinated to participate in multi-type frequency control ancillary services (FCASs). For optimal performance, scheduling in different timescales and the complementarity between power and energy types of requirements are coordinated, with various service uncertainties considered. Then the conditional value-at-risk theory is utilized to achieve the optimal mix of multiple resources for day-ahead regulation reserves, to realize the minimum operation cost. To tackle the uncertainty of wind power over a large timescale, a robust optimization (RO) approach based on the budget uncertainty set is employed, which considers robustness and economy. This can help avoid over-conservation of the standard RO and enhance the applicability of the decisions made. Simulation studies and comparison analysis of multiple schemes verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimal day-ahead dispatch strategy, which also demonstrate that a LS-BESS participating in multiple FCASs for day-ahead dispatch can help realize secure, reliable, and economic power grid.",grid scale batteri integr play import role renew energi integr format smart grid mitig problem insuffici frequenc respons peak regul capac face modern power grid high wind energi uptak day ahead optim dispatch strategi consid oper risk propos studi day ahead dispatch model gener unit larg scale batteri energi storag station l be coordin particip multi type frequenc control ancillari servic fcass optim perform schedul differ timescal complementar power energi type requir coordin variou servic uncertainti consid condit valu risk theori util achiev optim mix multipl resourc day ahead regul reserv realiz minimum oper cost tackl uncertainti wind power larg timescal robust optim ro approach base budget uncertainti set employ consid robust economi help avoid conserv standard ro enhanc applic decis made simul studi comparison analysi multipl scheme verifi effect propos optim day ahead dispatch strategi also demonstr l be particip multipl fcass day ahead dispatch help realiz secur reliabl econom power grid,0
Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in Battery Stacks Using Input Noise-Aware Nonlinear State Estimation and Cumulative Sum Algorithms,"—Grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are vulnerable to false data injection attacks (FDIAs), which could be used to disrupt state of charge (SoC) estimation. Inaccurate SoC estimation has negative impacts on system availability, reliability, safety, and the cost of operation. In this article a combination of a Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm and an improved input noise-aware extended Kalman ﬁlter (INAEKF) is proposed for the detection and identiﬁcation of FDIAs in the voltage and current sensors of a battery stack. The series-connected stack is represented by equivalent circuit models, the SoC is modeled with a charge reservoirmodelandthestatesareestimatedusingtheINAEKF.The root mean squared error of the states’ estimation by the modiﬁed INAEKF was found to be superior to the traditional EKF.

Introduction to grid-scale battery energy storage system concepts and fire hazards,"As the world continues to enact progressive climate change targets, renewable energy solutions are needed to achieve these goals. One such solution is large-scale lithium-ion battery (LIB) energy storage systems which are at the forefront in ensur- ing that solar- and wind-generated power is delivered when the grids need it most. However, the perceived hazards of LIBs due to recent events in the United States and Australia pose a risk to their future success. When a battery energy storage sys- tem (BESS) has a multilayered approach to safety, the thermal runaway, fire, and explosion hazards can be mitigated. Successful implementation of this approach requires cooperation, collaboration, and education across all stakeholder groups to break down these preconceived notions. Much can be learned from the recent BESS fire and explosion events to inform safer design and operation. These events and their contributing factors share many commonalities with historic losses in the hydro- carbon industry. Fire and process safety engineers who have traditionally worked in the hydrocarbon industry can be of immense value to the BESS industry. K E Y W O R D S alternative energy infrastructure, BESS, energy storage, fire engineering, lessons learned 1 | BATTERIES, POWER, AND THE GRID The way in which the world generates, transmits, and uses its energy is changing. We have been decarbonizing our electricity networks and transitioning our vehicles to run from petroleum fuels to batteries/fuel cells. Additionally, we are striving to make upgrades and expansions to transmission networks and use energy more wisely. We are now generating power with wind, solar, and wave tech- nologies, which are variable generation technologies because supply will vary over time based on the weather, daylight, and gravitational forces. When coupled with inflexible generation, such as nuclear which cannot quickly ramp up and down to match changes in energy demand, energy balancing issues ensue. This is because these variable and inflexible generation technologies do not provide the stable out- put that fossil fuels historically could guarantee. In a system where supply constantly must meet the demand, we are in danger of over- generating when the renewable generation is high and under- supplying when the conditions are less than favorable. This energy balancing challenge is symbolized in Figure 1. It is imperative that this theoretical scale is balanced. Energy storage is a piece of the solution, along with distributed generation and microgrids, which can hypothet- ically tip the scale. The risks of imbalance in the electrical grid are significant, most recently highlighted by a severe winter storm in Texas in February 2021, which resulted in the usage of power significantly outpacing production. As shown in Figure 2, this resulted in the Texas energy grid frequency dropping below a safety threshold of 59.4 hertz. Had the frequency stayed below this threshold for 9 min, the entire net- work would have shut down, as generating units would have tripped, disconnecting from the grid to protect themselves.1 There are a number of opportunities for energy storage to be deployed throughout the electricity network. Energy storage is not just limited to large power plants; it can be deployed at many loca- tions along the network.

Optimal Grid Flexibility Assessment for Integration of Variable Renewable-Based Electricity Generation,": This study delves into power system ﬂexibility, with a keen focus on the integration of variable renewable electricity generation into power grids. Two scenarios were analyzed. The base scenario revealed an aging grid, insufﬁcient generation capacity, frequent outages, and little renewable energy generation (1.9%), along with a signiﬁcant (71.23%) loss of load. In contrast, the investment scenario presented solutions including raising VRE capacity to 44%, adding 1000 MW capacity transmission lines, installing 200 MW capacity grid-scale battery storage, and technological enhancements. These interventions effectively eliminated loss of load, reinforcing energy resilience. Investments in CCGPP and grid-scale batteries proved instrumental in mitigating the variability of renewable energy. Improved transmission promised efﬁcient power exchange and regional collaboration. The elimination of annualized energy spills and the removal of ramping constraints marked signiﬁcant strides in enhancing power system ﬂexibility. This research underscores the pivotal role of grid ﬂexibility in accommodating VRE sources. By implementing the proposed optimal solutions, Afghanistan can lead the way toward a cleaner, more resilient, and more interconnected energy future. These ﬁndings offer a replicable framework for addressing similar challenges in integrating renewable energy sources globally and supporting the transition to sustainable and reliable energy.

Electrode Blocking Due to Redox Reactions in Aluminum Chloride-Sodium Iodide Molten Salts,"reactions in molten NaI/AlCl3 are shown to generate surface-blocking ﬁlms, which may limit the useful cycling rates and energy densities of molten sodium batteries below 150 °C. An experimental investigation of electrode interfacial stability at 110 °C reveals the source of the reaction rate limitations. Electrochemical experiments in a 3-electrode conﬁguration conﬁrm an increase of resistance on the electrode surface after oxidation or reduction current is passed. Using chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the ﬁlm formation is shown to depend on the electrode material (W, Mo, Ta, or glassy carbon), as well as the Lewis acidity and molar ratio of I−/I3 −in the molten salt electrolytes. These factors impact the amount of charge that can be passed at a given current density prior to developing excessive overpotential due to ﬁlm formation that blocks the electrode surface.

A review of solar hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors and systems,"In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in hybrid PV-T collectors and the wider systems within which they can be implemented, and assess the worldwide energy and carbon mitigation potential of these systems. We cover both experimental and computational studies, identify opportunities for performance enhancement, pathways for collector innovation, and implications of their wider deployment at the solar-generation system level. First, we classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air–water, heat-pipe, building integrated and concentrated PV-T collectors. This is followed by a presentation of performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we address wider PV-T systems and their applications, comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S–CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S–CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying and solar for hydrogen production systems. This includes a specific review of potential performance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, control and demand-side management. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed to analyse their carbon mitigation potential and how this technology might fit within pathways for global decarbonization. It is estimated that the REmap baseline emission curve can be reduced by more than 16% in 2030 if the uptake of solar PV-T technologies can be promoted. Finally, the review turns to a critical examination of key challenges for the adoption of PV-T technology and recommendations. 1.

"A review on global warming potential, challenges and opportunities of renewable hydrogen production technologies","This review compares global warming potential of renewable hydrogen production technologies including wind- and solar PV-powered water electrolysis, biomass gasification and biogas reforming based on 64 hydrogen production cases compiled from the literature. Unlike many previous studies, this review discusses the cases from various countries, while selecting the production technologies that have potential of commercialisation. Among the four reviewed technologies, wind electrolysis performed the best in global warming impacts (1.29 kg CO2 eq/ kg H2), whereas biogas reforming technology performed the worst (3.61 kg CO2 eq/kg H2). Key factors that contributed to most of the impacts were found to be materials used for construction of wind- and solar- electricity generation system for both wind- and solar PV-powered electrolysis, and energy consumption during gasification processes for biomass gasification, while methane leakage during biogas production had the highest contribution to the impacts of biogas reforming cases. On average, the renewable hydrogen cases demonstrated 68–92% lower global warming potential when compared to conventional coal gasification and natural gas steam methane reforming systems. Increasing demand for renewable hydrogen and possibility of hydrogen being integrated into existing natural gas networks highlight the important role of renewable hydrogen production in the future.",review compar global warm potenti renew hydrogen product technolog includ wind solar pv power water electrolysi biomass gasif bioga reform base hydrogen product case compil literatur unlik mani previou studi review discu case variou countri select product technolog potenti commercialis among four review technolog wind electrolysi perform best global warm impact kg co2 eq kg h2 wherea bioga reform technolog perform worst kg co2 eq kg h2 key factor contribut impact found materi use construct wind solar electr gener system wind solar pv power electrolysi energi consumpt gasif process biomass gasif methan leakag bioga product highest contribut impact bioga reform case averag renew hydrogen case demonstr lower global warm potenti compar convent coal gasif natur ga steam methan reform system increas demand renew hydrogen possibl hydrogen integr exist natur ga network highlight import role renew hydrogen product futur,1
Weather Impact on Solar Farm Performance: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques,": Forecasting the performance and energy yield of photovoltaic (PV) farms is crucial for establishing the economic sustainability of a newly installed system. The present study aims to develop a prediction model to forecast an installed PV system’s annual power generation yield and performance ratio (PR) using three environmental input parameters: solar irradiance, wind speed, and ambient air temperature. Three data-based artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), response surface methodology (RSM), and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), were employed. The models were developed using three years of data from an operational 2MWp Solar PV Project at Kuzhalmannam, Kerala state, India. Statistical indices such as Pearson’s R, coefﬁcient of determination (R2), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency (NSCE), mean absolute-percentage error (MAPE), Kling-Gupta efﬁciency (KGE), Taylor’s diagram, and correlation matrix were used to determine the most accurate prediction model. The results demonstrate that ANFIS was the most precise performance ratio prediction model, with an R2 value of 0.9830 and an RMSE of 0.6. It is envisaged that the forecast model would be a valuable tool for policymakers, solar energy researchers, and solar farm developers.

Voltage Sensorless Based Model Predictive Control With Battery Management System: For Solar PV Powered On-Board EV Charging,"—This work deals with a novel voltage sensorless based model predictive control (VSPC) scheme for continuous and quick maximum power harvesting (MPH) from a photo- voltaic (PV) array for a solar-powered on-board electric vehicle (EV) charging system. In VSPC, the ﬁrst model predictive control (MPC) is used with a PV array to predict the system state in the horizon of time and to eliminate the voltage sensor. An adaptive concept is used for deciding the operating point, which accelerates the tracking process and improves dynamic performance during irradiation changes and shading pattern changes in partially shaded conditions. Moreover, VSPC also takes care of the EV charging process using the EV-provided battery management system (BMS) command or threshold safety limits of the EV battery. The working principle of VSPC is based on a prediction of the future behavior of the system. It realizes on a selected time horizon, in an arbitrary number of samples, which is decided according to the complexity of the ﬁtness function. In order to minimize or maximize the ﬁtness function, it predicts the voltage of the solar PV array as well as tunes the present control signal, which forces it to converge or reach the convergence criteria. Moreover, the cost and response time of current sensors are lower than voltage sensors. Therefore, the VSPC control gives a fast response and low power oscillations in steady-state compared to conventional techniques. This control technique is veriﬁed on a developed prototype of the PV system in different shading and irradiance conditions, as well as the system stability, is analyzed through the Bode plot. The system performance is also compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Generation of green hydrogen using self-sustained regenerative fuel cells: Opportunities and challenges,"The ever-increasing energy demand, depleting fossil fuel reserves, and rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions have necessitated the transition towards the generation of green and clean energy through renewable energy sources. Solar energy is one such renewable energy source that has received signiﬁcant attention owing to its abundance and inexhaustibility. However, solar energy alone cannot replace fossil fuels in the energy portfolio. There exists a need to develop another clean energy source that can potentially act as an alternative to conventional fuels. Hydrogen proves to be an ideal candidate in this domain and can be sustainably generated by water electrolysis by powering the electro- lyzer using solar energy. The hydrogen thus synthesized has net zero carbon emissions and is a suitable asset for decarbonizing the environment. This review encompasses the generation of hydrogen using PV-Electrolyzer systems and addresses the challenges associated with the same. Overcoming these drawbacks can ensure a strong position for hydrogen as an alternative fuel in the energy infrastructure. By employing electrolyzers that are fueled by renewable energy and then using that hydrogen to feed a fuel cell, this study aims to clarify the potential and constraints of producing green hydrogen. Since this area of research has not yet been fully investigated, a review article that enables and en- courages academics to develop original solutions is urgently needed.",ever increas energi demand deplet fossil fuel reserv rise temperatur due greenhous ga emiss necessit transit toward gener green clean energi renew energi sourc solar energi one renew energi sourc receiv signiﬁc attent owe abund inexhaust howev solar energi alon replac fossil fuel energi portfolio exist need develop anoth clean energi sourc potenti act altern convent fuel hydrogen prof ideal candid domain sustain gener water electrolysi power electro lyzer use solar energi hydrogen thu synthes net zero carbon emiss suitabl asset decarbon environ review encompass gener hydrogen use pv electrolyz system address challeng associ overcom drawback ensur strong posit hydrogen altern fuel energi infrastructur employ electrolyz fuel renew energi use hydrogen feed fuel cell studi aim clarifi potenti constraint produc green hydrogen sinc area research yet fulli investig review articl enabl en courag academ develop origin solut urgent need,2
Design and investigation of PV string/central architecture for bayesian fusion technique using grey wolf optimization and flower pollination optimized algorithm,"One of the most essential factors in the current study is effectively harvesting the Maximum Power Extraction (MPE) from the Photovoltaic (PV) panel. The primary difficulties in extracting solar power is occurrence of partial shading which causes the panel to significantly increases power loss. These will mainly occur due to when partially shaded solar PV array kept under certain critical conditions for obtaining maximum output power. Many researcher have suggested by connecting bypass diodes in anti-parallel to the PV modules hotspots in the modules can be avoided. Out of all techniques, the proposed Bayesian Fusion Technique (BFT) is a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) techniques to optimize the performance of solar panels in photovoltaic (PV) systems. The combination of GWO and FPA forms an ideal combination that is beneficial for optimizing the performance of PV systems is determined in this work.

"Solar Energy: Applications, Trends Analysis, Bibliometric Analysis and Research Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",": Over the past decade, energy demand has witnessed a drastic increase, mainly due to huge development in the industry sector and growing populations. This has led to the global utilization of renewable energy resources and technologies to meet this high demand, as fossil fuels are bound to end and are causing harm to the environment. Solar PV (photovoltaic) systems are a renewable energy technology that allows the utilization of solar energy directly from the sun to meet electricity demands. Solar PV has the potential to create a reliable, clean and stable energy systems for the future. This paper discusses the different types and generations of solar PV technologies available, as well as several important applications of solar PV systems, which are “Large-Scale Solar PV”, “Residential Solar PV”, “Green Hydrogen”, “Water Desalination” and “Transportation”. This paper also provides research on the number of solar papers and their applications that relate to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the years between 2011 and 2021. A total of 126,513 papers were analyzed. The results show that 72% of these papers are within SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. This shows that there is a lack of research in solar energy regarding the SDGs, especially SDG 1: No Poverty, SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 10: Reduced Inequality and SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.

How to use the light spectrum through solar devices can profoundly affect the solar energy utilization, desalination rates, off-grid applicability, and water affordability. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal (ST) respectively have enabled a variety of interesting solar desalination technologies, but the resulting applications usually limit the integration between solar and desalination to be either electrically or thermally connected. Here this review paper explores smart co-uses of heat and electricity from the sun to improve the efficiency, productivity, and independence of various solar desalination processes. It is found that coupling solar photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) with desalination could be a practical and immediately deployable route for plausibly more sustainable solar desalination than current solutions, because the combined electrical and thermal energy outputs from PVT panels could be used synergistically to catalyze the improvement on the solar energy efficiency, specific energy consumption, and specific water production, as well as the operational inde­ pendence for off-grid applications. Our preliminary analysis indicated an up to 20 % lower cost of PVT-desalination than current solar PV-desalination and ST-desalination but also with challenges discussed.",electr thermal oper map ping pvt desalin review discu opportun smart co use electr heat identifi new integr option pvt desalin system preliminarili access pvt desal current solar desal system r c l e n f keyword solar desalin photovolta thermal solar energi effici specif energi consumpt water product b r c solar desalin emerg sustain solut address global water scarciti energi water nexu particularli remot area develop countri use light spectrum solar devic profoundli affect solar energi util desalin rate grid applic water afford solar photovolta pv solar thermal st respect enabl varieti interest solar desalin technolog result applic usual limit integr solar desalin either electr thermal connect review paper explor smart co us heat electr sun improv effici product independ variou solar desalin process found coupl solar photovolta thermal pvt desalin could practic immedi deploy rout plausibl sustain solar desalin current solut combin electr thermal energi output pvt panel could use synergist catalyz improv solar energi effici specif energi consumpt specif water product well oper ind pendenc grid applic preliminari analysi indic lower cost pvt desalin current solar pv desalin st desalin also challeng discuss,0
Research on the evolution of China's photovoltaic technology innovation network from the perspective of patents,"Photovoltaic (PV) technology, as a low-carbon energy technology, is crucial to mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable development. China has the largest total number of PV technology patents in the world, but the lack of core technologies has restricted the further innovative development of China’s PV industry. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify China’s current PV technology accumulation to better catch up with key technology areas. To clearly describe the structural characteristics of China’s PV technology innovation network, this study uses China’s patent PV technology data over the past 20 years from the Incopat global patent database and analyses the structural characteristics of the network from the perspectives of one-mode and two-mode networks, using method of social network analysis (SNA). The results show that 1) the leading PV enterprises have basically formed relatively stable internal collaborations and that the scale of innovation network devel­ opment has expanded rapidly, with very strong stamina; 2) with the development of China’s PV industry, many innovative PV techniques have been developed by leading enterprises in the field of innovation and research and development (R&D) of PV technology, and among patent applicants with strong collaboration, kinship collab­ oration with investment relationships is dominant; 3) provinces participating in PV technology innovation are increasing significantly, the network is more influenced by leading nodes, and the eastern coastal provinces are pioneers in the innovation and R&D of PV technology; and 4) PV technological innovation collaboration between patent applicants and cities has changed from local collaboration to cross-regional collaboration, high-value areas are basically concentrated in the eastern coastal region of China, with scattered spatial characteristics, and cross-regional collaboration presents a “triangular” spatial structure, with the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei as cores.

Electrolysis of low-grade and saline surface water,"exists for off-shore large-scale hydrogen production, a sector where the capital costs are domi- nated by the footprint of the installation, and the simplification in engineering by removing pre-treatment systems would have a great impact on the economic viability of such installations3. A route to reduce cost would be to use low-grade or saline water directly through development of efficient and selective catalytic electrode materials and the utilization of effective membranes in the electrolysers that are suitable for impure water. Therefore, ideal catalytic electrode materials and membranes should be able to deal with competing redox reactions at both electrodes, complications related to membrane function, reactor degradation and biofouling. Here we review key issues and recent research in electrolysis and the development of electrode materials/catalysts targeting direct use of low-grade and saline water in the electrolysis processes. In addi- tion, we address the major aspects in the design of electrolysers for hydrogen generation. Challenges of saline water electrolysis Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen is an energetically uphill chemical process where an external energy source is required to drive the reaction. In an electrolyser, electricity is converted to, and stored in the form of, chemical bonds.

Wind speed forecasting based on the hybrid ensemble empirical mode decomposition and GA-BP neural network method,"Wind speed is the major factor that affects the wind generation, and in turn the forecasting accuracy of wind speed is the key to wind power prediction. In this paper, a wind speed forecasting method based on improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and GA-BP neural network is proposed. EMD has been applied extensively for analyzing nonlinear stochastic signals. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is an improved method of EMD, which can effectively handle the mode-mixing problem and decompose the original data into more stationary signals with different frequencies. Each signal is taken as an input data to the GA-BP neural network model. The ﬁnal forecasted wind speed data is obtained by aggregating the predicted data of individual signals. Cases study of a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China, shows that the proposed hybrid method is much more accurate than the traditional GA-BP forecasting approach and GA-BP with EMD and wavelet neural network method. By the sensitivity analysis of pa- rameters, it can be seen that appropriate settings on parameters can improve the forecasting result. The simulation with MATLAB shows that the proposed method can improve the forecasting accuracy and computational efﬁciency, which make it suitable for on-line ultra-short term (10 min) and short term (1 h) wind speed forecasting.",wind speed major factor affect wind gener turn forecast accuraci wind speed key wind power predict paper wind speed forecast method base improv empir mode decomposit emd ga bp neural network propos emd appli extens analyz nonlinear stochast signal ensembl empir mode decomposit eemd improv method emd effect handl mode mix problem decompos origin data stationari signal differ frequenc signal taken input data ga bp neural network model ﬁnal forecast wind speed data obtain aggreg predict data individu signal case studi wind farm inner mongolia china show propos hybrid method much accur tradit ga bp forecast approach ga bp emd wavelet neural network method sensit analysi pa ramet seen appropri set paramet improv forecast result simul matlab show propos method improv forecast accuraci comput efﬁcienc make suitabl line ultra short term min short term h wind speed forecast,0
ERA5: The new champion of wind power modelling?,"Output from meteorological reanalyses are used extensively in both academia and industry for modelling wind power. Recently, the ﬁrst batch of the new ERA5 reanalysis was released. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of ERA5 and MERRA-2 (a commonly used reanalysis today) in terms of modelling i) the aggregated wind generation in ﬁve different countries and ii) the generation for 1051 individual wind turbines in Sweden. The modelled wind power generation was compared to measure- ments. In conclusion, ERA5 performs better than MERRA-2 in all analysed aspects; correlations are higher, mean absolute and root mean square errors are in average around 20% lower and distributions of both hourly data and changes in hourly data are more similar to those for measurements. It is also shown that the uncertainty related to long-term correction (using one year of measurements and reanalysis data to predict the energy production during the remaining 1e5 years) is 20% lower for ERA5. In fact, using one year sample data and ERA5 gives slightly more accurate estimates than using two years of sample data and MERRA-2. Additionally, a new metric for quantifying the system size and dispersion of wind farms is proposed.",output meteorolog reanalys use extens academia industri model wind power recent ﬁrst batch new era5 reanalysi releas main purpos paper compar perform era5 merra commonli use reanalysi today term model aggreg wind gener ﬁve differ countri ii gener 1051 individu wind turbin sweden model wind power gener compar measur ment conclus era5 perform better merra analys aspect correl higher mean absolut root mean squar error averag around lower distribut hourli data chang hourli data similar measur also shown uncertainti relat long term correct use one year measur reanalysi data predict energi product remain 1e5 year lower era5 fact use one year sampl data era5 give slightli accur estim use two year sampl data merra addit new metric quantifi system size dispers wind farm propos,0
"Feasibility study of an islanded microgrid in rural area consisting of PV, wind, biomass and battery energy storage system","Renewable energy systems are proving to be promising and environment friendly sources of electricity generation, particularly, in countries with inadequate fossil fuel resources. In recent years, wind, solar photovoltaic (PV) and biomass based systems have been drawing more attention to provide electricity to isolated or energy deﬁcient regions. This paper presents a hybrid PV-wind generation system along with biomass and storage to fulﬁll the electrical load demand of a small area. For optimal sizing of com- ponents, a recently introduced swarm based artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is applied. To verify the strength of the proposed technique, the results are compared with the results obtained from the standard software tool, hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER) and particle swarm optimiza- tion (PSO) algorithm. It has been veriﬁed from the results that the ABC algorithm has good convergence property and ability to provide good quality results. Further, for critical case such as the failure of any source, the behavior of the proposed system has been observed. It is evident from the results that the proposed scheme is able to manage a smooth power ﬂow with the same optimal conﬁguration.",renew energi system prove promis environ friendli sourc electr gener particularli countri inadequ fossil fuel resourc recent year wind solar photovolta pv biomass base system draw attent provid electr isol energi deﬁcient region paper present hybrid pv wind gener system along biomass storag fulﬁll electr load demand small area optim size com ponent recent introduc swarm base artiﬁci bee coloni abc algorithm appli verifi strength propos techniqu result compar result obtain standard softwar tool hybrid optim model electr renew homer particl swarm optimiza tion pso algorithm veriﬁ result abc algorithm good converg properti abil provid good qualiti result critic case failur sourc behavior propos system observ evid result propos scheme abl manag smooth power ﬂow optim conﬁgur,0
Real-Time Energy Storage Management for Renewable Integration in Microgrid: An Off-Line Optimization Approach,"—Microgrid is a key enabling solution to future smart grids by integrating distributed renewable generators and stor- age systems to efﬁciently serve the local demand. However, due to the random and intermittent characteristics of renewable energy, new challenges arise for the reliable operation of microgrids. To address this issue, we study in this paper the real-time energy management for a single microgrid system that constitutes a renewable generation system, an energy storage system, and an aggregated load. We model the renewable energy offset by the load over time, termed net energy proﬁle, to be practically predictable, but with ﬁnite errors that can be arbitrarily dis- tributed. We aim to minimize the total energy cost (modeled as sum of time-varying strictly convex functions) of the conven- tional energy drawn from the main grid over a ﬁnite horizon by jointly optimizing the energy charged/discharged to/from the storage system over time subject to practical load and storage constraints. To solve this problem in real time, we propose a new off-line optimization approach to devise the online algorithm. In this approach, we ﬁrst assume that the net energy proﬁle is perfectly predicted or known ahead of time, under which we derive the optimal off-line energy scheduling solution in closed- form. Next, inspired by the optimal off-line solution, we propose a sliding-window based online algorithm for real-time energy management under the practical setup of noisy predicted net energy proﬁle with arbitrary errors. Finally, we conduct simula- tions based on the real wind generation data of the Ireland power system to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm, as compared with other heuristically designed algorithms, as well as the conventional dynamic programming based solution.

Techno-economic optimization of hybrid photovoltaic/wind generation together with energy storage system in a stand-alone micro-grid subjected to demand response,"a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 4 January 2017 Received in revised form 9 May 2017 Accepted 14 May 2017 Available online 25 May 2017 Keywords: Size optimization Micro-grid Stand-alone Mixed integer linear programming Renewable resource energy Demand response a b s t r a c t Regarding the importance of supplying energy to regions that are far from power systems, this study is devoted to analyzing and modeling of a stand-alone micro-grid. In spite of many studies in the case of demand response programming for optimal management and operation cost reduction of the micro- grids, and regarding the importance of size optimization of micro-grids, this paper seeks to examine and investigate the ability of demand response programming in the case of component size optimization of a micro-grid. Due to deﬁciency or unavailability of dispatchable energy recourses, only the nondis- patchable renewable energy resources (wind and solar energy) are considered to supply the required energy. Applied strategy for effective component size optimization as well as relevant costs reduction is implemented by reducing or eliminating the mismatch between the generation and consumption pro- ﬁles by time shift and schedule of dispatchable loads. Furthermore, the effect of demand response utiliza- tion on loss of generated energy reduction is studied. The optimized results with and without demand response are extracted and compared to each other. For each case, the optimum conﬁguration was determined. Obtained results indicated that application of the demand response program, reduced the number of required batteries, the required inverter and photovoltaic cells capacity, and, consequently, the total net present costs. Furthermore, demand response implementation reduced the peak of consumed loads and increased the consumed load factor and corre- lation factor. The micro-grid components have been modeled mathematically within the framework of the mixed integer linear programming method. The optimization program has been performed by HOMER software together with GAMS software via the CPLEX solver.",r c l e n f articl histori receiv januari 2017 receiv revis form may 2017 accept may 2017 avail onlin may 2017 keyword size optim micro grid stand alon mix integ linear program renew resourc energi demand respons b r c regard import suppli energi region far power system studi devot analyz model stand alon micro grid spite mani studi case demand respons program optim manag oper cost reduct micro grid regard import size optim micro grid paper seek examin investig abil demand respons program case compon size optim micro grid due deﬁcienc unavail dispatch energi recours nondi patchabl renew energi resourc wind solar energi consid suppli requir energi appli strategi effect compon size optim well relev cost reduct implement reduc elimin mismatch gener consumpt pro ﬁle time shift schedul dispatch load furthermor effect demand respons utiliza tion loss gener energi reduct studi optim result without demand respons extract compar case optimum conﬁgur determin obtain result indic applic demand respons program reduc number requir batteri requir invert photovolta cell capac consequ total net present cost furthermor demand respons implement reduc peak consum load increas consum load factor corr lation factor micro grid compon model mathemat within framework mix integ linear program method optim program perform homer softwar togeth gam softwar via cplex solver,0
Optimal Prediction Intervals of Wind Power Generation,"—Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is es- sential to power system operation. Given signiﬁcant uncertainties involved in wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting provides a unique solution to estimate and quantify the potential impacts and risks facing system operation with wind penetration beforehand. This paper proposes a novel hybrid intelligent algo- rithm approach to directly formulate optimal prediction intervals of wind power generation based on extreme learning machine and particle swarm optimization. Prediction intervals with associated conﬁdence levels are generated through direct optimization of both the coverage probability and sharpness to ensure the quality. The proposed method does not involve the statistical inference or distribution assumption of forecasting errors needed in most existing methods. Case studies using real wind farm data from Australia have been conducted. Comparing with benchmarks applied, experimental results demonstrate the high efﬁciency and reliability of the developed approach. It is therefore convinced that the proposed method provides a new generalized framework for probabilistic wind power forecasting with high reliability and ﬂexibility and has a high potential of practical applications in power systems.

Role of power-to-gas in an integrated gas and electricity system in Great Britain,"Power-to-gas (PtG) converts electricity into hydrogen using the electrolysis process and uses the gas grid for the storage and transport of hydrogen. Hydrogen is injected into a gas network in a quantity and quality compatible with the gas safety regulations and thereby transported as a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas to demand centres. Once integrated into the electricity network, PtG systems can provide ﬂexibility to the power system and absorb excess electricity from renewables to produce hydrogen. Injection of hydrogen into the gas network reduces gas volumes supplied from terminals. In order to investigate this concept, hydrogen electrolysers were included as a tech- nology option within an operational optimisation model of the Great Britain (GB) combined gas and electricity network (CGEN). The model was used to determine the minimum cost of meeting the electricity and gas demand in a typical low and high electricity demand day in GB, in the presence of a signiﬁcant capacity of wind generation. The value of employing power-to-gas systems in the gas and electricity supply system was investigated given different allowable levels of hydrogen injections. The results showed that producing hydrogen from electricity is capable of reducing wind curtailment in a high wind case and decreasing the overall cost of operating the GB gas and electricity network. The northern part of GB was identiﬁed as a suitable region to develop hydrogen electrolysis and injection facilities due to its vicinity to a signiﬁcant capacity of wind generation, as well as the ex- istence of gas network headroom capacity, which is expected to increase as a result of depletion of UK domestic gas resources.

Dealing with multiple decades of hourly wind and PV time series in energy models: A comparison of methods to reduce time resolution and the planning implications of inter-annual variability,"Using a high-resolution planning model of the Great Britain power system and 25 years of simulated wind and PV generation data, this study compares different methods to reduce time resolution of energy models to increase their computational tractability: downsampling, clustering, and heuristics. By com- paring model results in terms of costs and installed capacities across different methods, this study shows that the best method depends heavily on input data and the setup of model constraints. This implies that there is no one-size-ﬁts-all approach to the problem of time step reduction, but heuristic approaches appear promising. In addition, the 25 years of time series demonstrate considerable inter-year variability in wind and PV power output. This further complicates the problem of time detail in energy models as it suggests long time series are necessary. Model results with high shares of PV and wind generation using a single or few years of data are likely unreliable. Better modeling and planning methods are required to determine robust scenarios with high shares of variable renewables. The methods are implemented in the freely available open-source modeling framework Calliope.",use high resolut plan model great britain power system year simul wind pv gener data studi compar differ method reduc time resolut energi model increas comput tractabl downsampl cluster heurist com pare model result term cost instal capac across differ method studi show best method depend heavili input data setup model constraint impli one size ﬁt approach problem time step reduct heurist approach appear promis addit year time seri demonstr consider inter year variabl wind pv power output complic problem time detail energi model suggest long time seri necessari model result high share pv wind gener use singl year data like unreli better model plan method requir determin robust scenario high share variabl renew method implement freeli avail open sourc model framework calliop,0
The merit-order effect in the Italian power market: The impact of solar and wind generation on national wholesale electricity prices,"Italy promoted one of the most generous renewable support schemes worldwide which resulted in a high increase of solar power generation. We analyze the Italian day-ahead wholesale electricity market, ﬁnding empirical evidence of the merit-order effect. Over the period 2005–2013 an increase of 1 GWh in the hourly average of daily production from solar and wind sources has, on average, reduced wholesale electricity prices by respectively 2.3€/MWh and 4.2€/MWh and has ampliﬁed their volatility. The impact on prices has decreased over time in correspondence with the increase in solar and wind electricity production. We estimate that, over the period 2009–2013, solar production has generated higher monetary savings than wind production, mainly because the former is more prominent than the latter. However, in the solar case, monetary savings are not sufﬁcient to compensate the cost of the related supporting schemes which are entirely internalized within end-user tariffs, causing a reduction of the consumer surplus, while the opposite occurs in the case of wind. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Undoubtedly, many studies previously focused on dem- onstrating the inﬂuence of socio-economic factors that lead to better environmental quality. However, the empirical literature on tourism, social well-being, foreign direct investment, and the Environment in Belt and Road developed economies needed improvement. This research applied a series of advanced estimators that help demonstrate the study’s probable results. This study explores the role of Social well-being (HDI), tourism development, FDI, renewable energy, information & communi- cation technology (ICT), and urbanization on CO2 emissions in Belt and Road (BRI) developed economies.Estimated results exhibited the signiﬁ- cant contribution of ICT and renewable energy to sustainability. Besides, FDI contributes to emissions reduction after its threshold level. Con- versely, urbanization and tourism activities contribute to environmental pollution. The study outcomes stated inverted/EKC U-shaped hypotheses related to speciﬁed economies. Finally, the analysis based on the D-H panel causality test constructs exciting results.The present study concludes that economic corridor plays a vital role in tourism development, the com- munity’s well-being, and SDGs goals (sustainable development) impact on environmental safety. The ﬁndings suggest essential and applicable policies to attain the desired sustainability level. Findings contribute to the liter- ature on tourism, well-being, and sustainability.

Applications of Green Synthesized Metal Nanoparticles - a Review,"Green nanotechnology is an emerging field of science that focuses on the production of nanoparticles by living cells through biological pathways. This topic plays an extremely imperative responsibility in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, nuclear energy, fuel and energy, electronics, and bioengineering. Biological processes by green synthesis tools are more suitable to develop nanoparticles ranging from 1 to 100 nm compared to other related methods, owing to their safety, eco- friendliness, non-toxicity, and cost-effectiveness. In particular, the metal nanoparticles are synthesized by top-down and bottom-up approaches through various techniques like physical, chemical, and biological methods. Their characterization is very vital and the confirmation of nanoparticle traits is done by various instrumentation analyses such as UV–Vis spectro- photometry (UV–Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmis- sion electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), and intracranial pressure (ICP). In this review, we provide especially information on green synthesized metal nanoparticles, which are helpful to improve biomedical and environmental applications.

Race to carbon neutrality in South Africa: What role does environmental technological innovation play?,"Governments worldwide have prioritized carbon reduction and neutrality to address the escalating threat of climate change. These goals are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG-13). These goals stress taking action on climate change to lessen the bad effects of human activities and using fossil fuels for energy. To this end, the present study investigates the connection between conventional energy usage, agricultural practices, economic growth, and their impact on environmental sustainability in South Africa. Additionally, it explores the role of renewable energy consumption and environmental technological innovation in mitigating these effects. To achieve the study objectives, a carbon-income function is fitted with an annual frequency data from 1975 to 2020. The present study leverages on Pesaran's Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method and for robustness analysis the dynamic ARDL simulations method to simultaneously explore the short and long-run coefficients of the study's outlined variables. Empirical analysis, confirmed by bounds testing for cointegration, reveals a long-term equilibrium relationship among the variables considered. Notably, eco­ nomic growth, fossil fuel energy consumption, and agricultural activities have adverse effects on environmental sustainability in South Africa, indicating a trade-off between economic growth and environmental quality. Dy­ namic ARDL simulations provide further evidence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) phenomenon. However, renewable energy consumption and environmental technological innovation positively influence environmental quality.

It also provides the foundation for green energy production, and thus, indirectly supports the accomplishment of SDG 7. Notably, the energy transition from fossil fuel to renewables is critical for achieving sustainable develop- ment and a cleaner environment. Therefore, this study explores the major driving forces of environmental innovation in 29 OECD countries from 1993 to 2019 by incorporating environmental taxation, carbon pricing policy, budget for renewable energy development and demonstration, regional authority, ﬁnan- cial development, and globalization. The recently proposed Quantile via Movements methodology is employed to address the spiral dependence of explanatory variables and obtain results at different quan- tiles. The ﬁndings of Quantile via movements reveal that enhancing environmental taxation and strengthening carbon pricing policies encourage environmental innovation. Moreover, these countries should decentralize policymaking and delegate authority to regions. Alongside this, policymaking for encouraging the private sector budgets for renewable energy development and demonstration is neces- sary. The stringent policy regulations at the regional level can enhance the innovation of domestic indus- tries concerning the development, adoption, and commercial competitiveness of environment-friendly technologies. Furthermore, the ﬁnancial sector’s development enhances environmental innovation, while globalization needs to be properly regulated.",environment innov integr part sustain develop goal sdg also provid foundat green energi product thu indirectli support accomplish sdg notabl energi transit fossil fuel renew critic achiev sustain develop ment cleaner environ therefor studi explor major drive forc environment innov oecd countri 1993 2019 incorpor environment taxat carbon price polici budget renew energi develop demonstr region author ﬁnan cial develop global recent propos quantil via movement methodolog employ address spiral depend explanatori variabl obtain result differ quan tile ﬁnding quantil via movement reveal enhanc environment taxat strengthen carbon price polici encourag environment innov moreov countri decentr policymak deleg author region alongsid policymak encourag privat sector budget renew energi develop demonstr nece sari stringent polici regul region level enhanc innov domest indu tri concern develop adopt commerci competit environ friendli technolog furthermor ﬁnancial sector develop enhanc environment innov global need properli regul,0
Enhancing resource efficiency through the utilization of the green bond market: An empirical analysis of Asian economies,"This research explores the effects of the green bonds market on resource efficiency across 12 actively involved Asian economies from 2015 to 2022. The empirical results indicate a positive connection between green bond issuance and resource efficiency, suggesting that a 1% increase in green bonds corresponds to significant short- term (0.33%) and long-term (0.43%) improvements. Surprisingly, a negative relationship is observed between GDP growth and resource efficiency, implying that economic expansion may contribute to heightened resource consumption. The study highlights the favorable impact of renewable power generation on resource efficiency, driven by the sustainability of renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, challenges arise from poverty ratios and consumer price indices, impeding the adoption of resource-efficient technology. Furthermore, while cell phone penetration initially benefits resource efficiency, a negative correlation emerges in the long term due to increased non-renewable energy consumption. In light of these findings, the study recommends practical policies for sustainable development, including actively promoting the green bonds market, targeted investments in renewable energy, and initiatives to address economic disparities while encouraging resource-efficient practices.",research explor effect green bond market resourc effici across activ involv asian economi 2015 2022 empir result indic posit connect green bond issuanc resourc effici suggest increas green bond correspond signific short term long term improv surprisingli neg relationship observ gdp growth resourc effici impli econom expans may contribut heighten resourc consumpt studi highlight favor impact renew power gener resourc effici driven sustain renew energi sourc nevertheless challeng aris poverti ratio consum price index imped adopt resourc effici technolog furthermor cell phone penetr initi benefit resourc effici neg correl emerg long term due increas non renew energi consumpt light find studi recommend practic polici sustain develop includ activ promot green bond market target invest renew energi initi address econom dispar encourag resourc effici practic,0
Recent advancement and assessment of green hydrogen production technologies,"Hydrogen energy has garnered substantial support from industry, government, and the public, positioning it as a pivotal future fuel source. However, its commercial realisation faces significant hurdles, including slow infra­ structure growth and the high cost of producing clean hydrogen. This review uniquely emphasises the different colour codes of hydrogen, which have been rarely discussed in the literature to date. Hydrogen production methods are classified by colour codes, with green hydrogen, produced from renewable sources such as wind and solar, being the most desirable option. The demand for green hydrogen across various sectors is expected to surge. This review comprehensively evaluates the major hydrogen production methods based on cost, envi­ ronmental impact, and technological maturity. Recent data confirm the increased efficiency, cost- competitiveness, and scalability of green hydrogen production technologies. The cost of green hydrogen has declined significantly, making it competitive with blue hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels with carbon cap­ ture). The review also scrutinises several recent hydrogen production technologies, highlighting their advan­ tages, disadvantages, and technological readiness. Among these, the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) currently outperforms others, with anion exchange membrane (AEM) and electrified steam methane reforming (ESMR) also showing promise. This review also succinctly summarises global progress in hydrogen infrastructure and policies. By spotlighting the diverse colour codes of hydrogen and discussing the crucial takeaways and impli­ cations for the future, this review offers a comprehensive overview of the hydrogen energy landscape. This unique focus enriches the literature and enhances our understanding of hydrogen as a promising energy source.",hydrogen energi garner substanti support industri govern public posit pivot futur fuel sourc howev commerci realis face signific hurdl includ slow infra structur growth high cost produc clean hydrogen review uniqu emphasi differ colour code hydrogen rare discuss literatur date hydrogen product method classifi colour code green hydrogen produc renew sourc wind solar desir option demand green hydrogen across variou sector expect surg review comprehens evalu major hydrogen product method base cost envi ronment impact technolog matur recent data confirm increas effici cost competit scalabl green hydrogen product technolog cost green hydrogen declin significantli make competit blue hydrogen produc fossil fuel carbon cap ture review also scrutinis sever recent hydrogen product technolog highlight advan tage disadvantag technolog readi among solid oxid electrolysi cell soec current outperform other anion exchang membran aem electrifi steam methan reform esmr also show promis review also succinctli summaris global progress hydrogen infrastructur polici spotlight divers colour code hydrogen discuss crucial takeaway impli cation futur review offer comprehens overview hydrogen energi landscap uniqu focu enrich literatur enhanc understand hydrogen promis energi sourc,2
"Modeling the linkage between climate-tech, energy transition, and CO2 emissions: Do environmental regulations matter?","The transition from conventional energy to clean energy is the ultimate strategy to reduce global CO2 emissions. In this regard, climate technologies (climate-tech) can pave the way toward achieving the capabilities required to promote alternative energy and energy saving. In addition, environmental regu- lations can support technological upgrading, energy transition, and emissions reduction to promote sus- tainable development. With this in view, this study investigates the impact of climate technologies (climate-tech) and energy transitions on CO2 emissions in the European Union (EU) member countries. Further, we examine the role of environmental regulation in the relationship between climate-tech, energy transition, and CO2 emissions. The empirical analysis is conducted based on international panel data for 26 EU countries ranging from 1994 to 2019, and the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCE-MG) method is employed to estimate the coefﬁcients of the variables. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that both climate-tech and energy transitions mitigate environmental degradation by reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, environmental regulations are found to be an effective monitoring and controlling tool that can signiﬁcantly reduce CO2 emissions. Moreover, economic growth and urbaniza- tion as control variables contribute to increasing CO2 emissions, thus negatively affecting environmental sustainability. The causal analysis demonstrates that decision-making trends related to climate-tech, energy transition, and environmental regulations inﬂuence CO2 emissions. Conversely, strategies for cop- ing with CO2 emissions and climate change will affect energy transitions and environmental regulations. In light of these analytical ﬁndings, this paper proposes that EU countries should vigorously develop climate-related green technologies and actively promote the energy transition process along with the implementation of environmental regulations for sustainable development.",transit convent energi clean energi ultim strategi reduc global co2 emiss regard climat technolog climat tech pave way toward achiev capabl requir promot altern energi energi save addit environment regu lation support technolog upgrad energi transit emiss reduct promot su tainabl develop view studi investig impact climat technolog climat tech energi transit co2 emiss european union eu member countri examin role environment regul relationship climat tech energi transit co2 emiss empir analysi conduct base intern panel data eu countri rang 1994 2019 common correl effect mean group cce mg method employ estim coefﬁcient variabl outcom analysi indic climat tech energi transit mitig environment degrad reduc carbon emiss addit environment regul found effect monitor control tool signiﬁcantli reduc co2 emiss moreov econom growth urbaniza tion control variabl contribut increas co2 emiss thu neg affect environment sustain causal analysi demonstr decis make trend relat climat tech energi transit environment regul inﬂuenc co2 emiss convers strategi cop ing co2 emiss climat chang affect energi transit environment regul light analyt ﬁnding paper propos eu countri vigor develop climat relat green technolog activ promot energi transit process along implement environment regul sustain develop,0
Novel Pt-carbon core-shell decorated hierarchical CoMo2S4 as efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline/seawater hydrogen evolution reaction,"A B S T R A C T Electrochemical water electrolysis is a prominent method of green-hydrogen fuel production. Tailored nano­ structures of Pt-based electrocatalysts have high priority in hydrogen production. Herein, we fabricated carbon- encapsulated Pt core–shell supported CoMo2S4-NGNF as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The novel carbon-encapsulated Pt core shells improved the long-term durability. The Pt@Co­ Mo2S4-NGNF hybrids displayed overpotentials of 27 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH and outstanding durability of 100 h. When Pt@CoMo2S4-NGNF‖IrO2 was employed in overall seawater electrolysis applications, it required 1.54 V to achieve a 10 mA cm−2 current density. Additionally, we evaluated the electronic structure and HER mechanism of Pt@CoMo2S4 & CoMo2S4 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work illustrates the possibility of designing an effective, long-lasting, and scalable electro­ catalyst for the electrolysis of alkaline and seawater to produce pure hydrogen.",b r c electrochem water electrolysi promin method green hydrogen fuel product tailor nano structur pt base electrocatalyst high prioriti hydrogen product herein fabric carbon encapsul pt coreshel support como2s4 ngnf effici electrocatalyst hydrogen evolut reaction novel carbon encapsul pt core shell improv long term durabl mo2s4 ngnf hybrid display overpotenti mv achiev current densiti cm koh outstand durabl h ngnfiro2 employ overal seawat electrolysi applic requir v achiev cm current densiti addit evalu electron structur mechan como2s4 use densiti function theori dft calcul work illustr possibl design effect long last scalabl electro catalyst electrolysi alkalin seawat produc pure hydrogen,1
Tuning Mass Transport in Electrocatalysis Down to Sub-5 nm through Nanoscale Grade Separation,": Nano and single-atom catalysis open new possibilities of producing green hydrogen (H2) by water electrolysis. However, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which occurs at a characteristic reaction rate proportional to the potential, the fast generation of H2 nanobubbles at atomic-scale interfaces often leads to the blockage of active sites. Herein, a nanoscale grade-separation strategy is proposed to tackle mass-transport problem by utilizing ordered three- dimensional (3d) interconnected sub-5 nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss-crossing mesopores with grade separation allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium (Ru), the 3d mesopores are on a superior level to two-dimensional system at maximizing the catalyst performance and the obtained Ru catalyst outperforms most of the other HER catalysts. This work provides a potential route to fine-tuning few-nanometer mass transport during water electrolysis.",nano singl atom catalysi open new possibl produc green hydrogen h2 water electrolysi howev hydrogen evolut reaction occur characterist reaction rate proport potenti fast gener h2 nanobubbl atom scale interfac often lead blockag activ site herein nanoscal grade separ strategi propos tackl mass transport problem util order three dimension 3d interconnect sub nm pore result reveal 3d criss cross mesopor grade separ allow effici diffus h2 bubbl along interconnect channel support ultrafin ruthenium ru 3d mesopor superior level two dimension system maxim catalyst perform obtain ru catalyst outperform catalyst work provid potenti rout fine tune nanomet mass transport water electrolysi,1
Photocatalytic H2O2 production Systems: Design strategies and environmental applications,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly versatile oxidant, which has been used in chemical industry, medical, energy, and environmental fields. Photocatalytic H2O2 production is a sustainable, safe, and green process; however, the high recombination of electron-hole pairs, low visible light utilization, and poor product selectivity still limit the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 production. Previous reviews on photocatalytic H2O2 generation focus more on the photocatalysts but less on the design strategy of the photo­ catalytic systems, which stems from the critical steps involving the photocatalytic process, i.e., light absorption, charge separation, and surface redox reaction. From this point of review, this review article introduces the strategies for improving the H2O2 production efficiency based on the above three critical processes. Moreover, the environmental applications of photocatalytic H2O2 generation including disinfection and pollutant degra­ dation are discussed. The challenges and prospects in photocatalytic H2O2 production and its future environ­ mental applications are also envisioned.",hydrogen peroxid h2o2 environment friendli versatil oxid use chemic industri medic energi environment field photocatalyt h2o2 product sustain safe green process howev high recombin electron hole pair low visibl light util poor product select still limit practic applic photocatalyt h2o2 product previou review photocatalyt h2o2 gener focu photocatalyst le design strategi photo catalyt system stem critic step involv photocatalyt process ie light absorpt charg separ surfac redox reaction point review review articl introduc strategi improv h2o2 product effici base three critic process moreov environment applic photocatalyt h2o2 gener includ disinfect pollut degra dation discuss challeng prospect photocatalyt h2o2 product futur environ mental applic also envis,1
La- and Mn-doped cobalt spinel oxygen evolution catalyst for proton exchange membrane electrolysis,"earth-abundant electrocatalysts to replace iridium for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) represents a critical step in reducing the cost for green hydrogen production. We report a nanofibrous cobalt spinel catalyst codoped with lanthanum (La) and manganese (Mn) prepared from a zeolitic imidazolate framework embedded in electrospun polymer fiber. The catalyst demonstrated a low overpotential of 353 millivolts at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter and a low degradation for OER over 360 hours in acidic electrolyte. A PEMWE containing this catalyst at the anode demonstrated a current density of 2000 milliamperes per square centimeter at 2.47 volts (Nafion 115 membrane) or 4000 milliamperes per square centimeter at 3.00 volts (Nafion 212 membrane) and low degradation in an accelerated stress test. L ow-temperature water electrolysis can rapidly produce environmentally sus- tainable, or green, hydrogen and is a prospective means of storing energy from renewable but intermittent power sources, such as wind and solar, in future clean energy infrastructure (1–4). Commercial systems use either liquid alkaline electrolyte or proton ex- change membrane electrolyte (1). Compared with the alkaline counterpart, a proton ex- change membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) offers the advantages of higher current density, higher H2 purity, lower resistance losses, and more compact design, rendering it a preferred technology where high efficiency and small footprint are essential (1, 2). Working under the acidic and oxidative environment, how- ever, adds substantial challenges to the catalyst activity and stability profile. This is particularly the case for the anode catalyst because of the high overpotential for oxygen evolution reac- tion (OER) (3). At present, OER catalysts for PEMWE are primarily restricted to the plat- inum group metal (PGM) materials, such as IrOx (1). Their high cost and limited reserve, however, pose substantial barriers to the wide- spread implementation of PEMWE. Low-cost transition metals and their oxides are known to be active toward OER in alkaline electrolyte (4–6), but their demonstration in acidic elec- trolyte is very limited (1, 7, 8). Cobalt molecular and oxide compounds have emerged as promising OER catalysts for water splitting in recent years (9). Kanan and Nocera systematically investigated water oxidation using a catalyst deposited from Co2+ solution in pH 7 phosphate buffer (10). Gerken et al. performed a comprehensive mechanistic study of cobalt-catalyzed water oxidation from homo- geneous to heterogeneous phases in electrolyte over a broad pH range of 0 to 14 (11). Those studies have provided profound understanding of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution by cobalt. More recently, thin film spinel-type Co3O4 was found to be active toward OER and stable at low overpotential in acid (12). The activity and stability of Co oxide were improved substan- tially when modified with iron, manganese, antimonite, and PbOx (13–15). In addition to activity and stability, the inherent conductivity represents an essential requirement for ef- ficient OER electrocatalysis to overcome the insulating properties of most transition metal oxides in their crystalline form. Conventional carbon supports, used to facilitate the elec- tron conductivity, are not stable against oxi- dation to CO2 at the PEMWE anode under OER operating potential. For example, a Co- polyoxometalate composited with carbon paste achieved a lower OER onset potential than IrO2 in 1 M sulfuric acid but decayed quickly, presumably as a result of oxidative corrosion of the carbon (16). Self-conductive oxide cat- alysts can also enhance the active -site volu- metric density without being diluted by a secondary nonactive support. A recently devel- oped self-healing OER catalyst has demon- strated excellent activity and durability in acidic electrolyte (14). The approach, however, requires the presence of metal precursors in the aqueous electrolyte, hindering integration into a PEMWE. Most of the aforementioned studies were carried out either in half-cells or aqueous electrolyzers, where the demands for OER catalyst stability and conductivity are different from those in a PEMWE. For exam- ple, the dissolved transition metal concentra- tion must be minimized to avoid poisoning the proton exchange membrane in the PEMWE. Effective OER for PEMWE requires optimal interfacial properties, microporosity, and sur- face catalytic activity (1), all of which need to be validated in the operating electrolyzer. In this work, we present a cobalt spinel– based OER catalyst derived from a zeolitic methyl-imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF) and processed by electrospinning. The catalyst demonstrated excellent OER activity ben- efiting from its high specific surface area, porous interconnected nanonetwork structure, and high conductivity. Design of an acid-stable cobalt OER catalyst Our design concept of an efficient cobalt spinel–based OER catalyst for PEMWE anodes is based on the following rationale: To en- hance OER activity in acid, an oversized and more stable second element can be selectively introduced to the cobalt oxide surface to generate strain, oxygen vacancy (Vo), and acid tolerance (17); to improve the oxide electronic conductivity, a third element with similar charge and dimension to cobalt may be in- corporated inside the lattice to bridge the Fermi bandgap through d orbital partial oc- cupation of the third element induced by its d-electron delocalization. Advancing further from the rotating disk electrode (RDE) or half- cell study to a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) demonstration, the catalyst should have a high porosity and surface area easily accessible to the reactant (H2O). Meanwhile, the electrode layer should be effective in trans- porting H2O and releasing O2 without blocking the water-catalyst interface. Furthermore, the oxide catalyst should be self-conductive with- out the need for another conductive support, such as carbon, that is unstable under high OER operating potential and current density. Finally, the metal oxide should be stable against oxidative and acidic (pH 2 to 4) corrosion in the PEMWE environment. We selected Co-ZIF as the precursor for the catalyst preparation because of its high intrin- sic porosity and reticular structure. It has re- cently been used to prepare a nanoplate oxide with excellent OER activity tested in strong alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH) using the RDE method (18). Our catalyst preparation through low-temperature oxidation partially retained the porosity and morphology of Co-ZIFs after their conversion into interconnected hollow metal oxide particles, providing an excellent platform for enhanced charge and mass transfer. Among different elements that we screened, we selected lanthanum (La3+) as the second element because of its much larger radius compared with that of Co2+ (1.06 Å versus 0.72 Å) along with its strong affinity to bind −OH groups at the surface of cobalt oxide. We also added manganese ions (Mn2+) of similar RESEARCH Chong et al., Science 380, 609–616 (2023) 12 May 2023 1 of 8 1Chemical Science and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL

Arming Ru with Oxygen-Vacancy-Enriched RuO2 Sub-Nanometer Skin Activates Superior Bifunctionality for pH-Universal Overall Water Splitting,"has been expected to assimilate the renewable yet intermediate energy-derived electricity for green H2 production. However, current benchmark anodic catalysts of Ir/Ru-based compounds suﬀer severely from poor dissolution resistance. Herein, an eﬀective modiﬁcation strategy is proposed by arming a sub-nanometer RuO2 skin with abundant oxygen vacancies to the interconnected Ru clusters/carbon hybrid microsheet (denoted as Ru@V-RuO2/C HMS), which can not only inherit the high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the Ru, but more importantly, activate the superior activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acid and alkaline conditions. Outstandingly, it can achieve an ultralow overpotential of 176/201 mV for OER and 46/6 mV for the HER to reach 10 mA cm−2 in acidic and alkaline solution, respectively. Inspiringly, the overall water splitting can be driven with an ultrasmall cell voltage of 1.467/1.437 V for 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 m H2SO4/1.0 m KOH, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that armoring the oxygen-vacancy-enriched RuO2 exoskeleton can cooperatively alter the interfacial electronic structure and make the adsorption behavior of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates much close to the ideal level, thus simultaneously speeding up the hydrogen evolution kinetics and decreasing the energy barrier of oxygen release.

Strategies to save energy in the context of the energy crisis: a review,"New technologies, systems, societal organization and policies for energy saving are urgently needed in the context of accel- erated climate change, the Ukraine conflict and the past coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects. The global energy consumption in 2020 was 30.01% for the industry, 26.18% for transport, and 22.08% for residential sectors. 10–40% of energy consumption can be reduced using renewable energy sources, passive design strategies, smart grid analytics, energy-efficient building systems, and intelligent energy monitoring. Electric vehicles offer the highest cost-per-kilometer reduction of 75% and the lowest energy loss of 33%, yet battery-related issues, cost, and weight are challenging. 5–30% of energy can be saved using automated and networked vehicles. Artificial intelligence shows a huge potential in energy saving by improving weather forecasting and machine maintenance and ena- bling connectivity across homes, workplaces, and transportation. For instance, 18.97–42.60% of energy consumption can be reduced in buildings through deep neural networking.

Highly efficient adsorption and removal bio-staining dye from industrial wastewater onto mesoporous Ag-MOFs,"Adsorption is an effective and promising approach for removing pollutants from wastewater. Too many haz­ ardous colors were unintentionally released into the water, which had a negative impact on the environment. A popular textile dye is malachite green (MG). Thus, in this work, an environmentally acceptable inorganic-organic Ag metal-organic framework-based technique to remove colors from industrial water was developed (Ag-MOF). The sorbent was analyzed in the first section of the work using SEM, XPS, XRD, FT-IR, pHpzc, and BET, which confirmed that the Ag-MOF had the BET surface area, is 676 m2/g, which is a significant surface area. In a later stage, the sorption properties of the dye were examined along with the effects of pH, sorbent dosage, temper­ ature, and ionic strength; the sorption isotherms and uptake kinetics were examined: As opposed to the kinetic profile, Isotherm profiles are well-fit by the Langmuir equation and can be modeled by the pseudo-second order rate equation. The outcomes further demonstrated that MG was mostly adsorbed onto Ag-MOF adsorbent by electrostatic attraction forces, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange, and pore filling. 2.25 mmol/g was found to be the greatest adsorption effectiveness of MG onto Ag-MOF adsorbent. (i.e. 809.71 mg/g). Adsorbent dosage, solution pH, temperature, and time were the four adsorption process parameters that were tuned using Box- Behnken design (BBD) in response surface methodology (RSM). The (ΔH◦), (ΔS◦), and (ΔG◦) MG dye was endothermically and spontaneously extracted using Ag-MOF as an adsorbent, according to the specifications. Up to five cycles of adsorption-desorption, the synthesised Ag-MOF adsorbent demonstrates exceptional render ability and cyclability. The produced adsorbent’s efficacy for purifying wastewater samples at a laboratory scale was assessed as a proof of concept. Study the mechanism of interaction between the Ag-MOF and MG as it could be take place through π-π interaction, pore filling, H-Bonding or electrostatic interaction. The mesoporous Ag- MOF adsorbent offered a simple and effective way to handle water filtering and industrial wastewater man­ agement. According to our research, this work is the first to explain how to remove MG dye from wastewater samples using Ag-MOF adsorbents.",adsorpt effect promis approach remov pollut wastewat mani haz ardou color unintent releas water neg impact environ popular textil dye malachit green mg thu work environment accept inorgan organ ag metal organ framework base techniqu remov color industri water develop ag mof sorbent analyz first section work use sem xp xrd ft ir phpzc bet confirm ag mof bet surfac area m2 g signific surfac area later stage sorption properti dye examin along effect ph sorbent dosag temper atur ionic strength sorption isotherm uptak kinet examin oppos kinet profil isotherm profil well fit langmuir equat model pseudo second order rate equat outcom demonstr mg mostli adsorb onto ag mof adsorb electrostat attract forc hydrogen bond ion exchang pore fill mmol g found greatest adsorpt effect mg onto ag mof adsorb ie mg g adsorb dosag solut ph temperatur time four adsorpt process paramet tune use box behnken design bbd respons surfac methodolog rsm δh δs δg mg dye endotherm spontan extract use ag mof adsorb accord specif five cycl adsorpt desorpt synthesis ag mof adsorb demonstr except render abil cyclabl produc adsorb efficaci purifi wastewat sampl laboratori scale assess proof concept studi mechan interact ag mof mg could take place π π interact pore fill h bond electrostat interact mesopor ag mof adsorb offer simpl effect way handl water filter industri wastewat man agement accord research work first explain remov mg dye wastewat sampl use ag mof adsorb,1
"Environmental impact of renewable energy source based electrical power plants: Solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, tidal, ocean, and osmotic","Renewable energy source (RES) based electrical power plants are widely considered green and clean due to their contribution to decarbonizing the energy sectors. It is apparent that RESs do not produce carbon dioxide, however their significant negative impacts on the environment are still found and cannot be ignored. In this paper, the environmental impacts of RES based power plants are analyzed through a comprehensive review considering solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, tidal, ocean current, oceanic wave, ocean thermal, and osmotic effects. Solar thermal power is well known as concentrated solar power. A strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis is carried out and discussed for all RES based power plants. Comparative SWOT analyses for solar photovoltaic and concentrated solar power plants are presented. The comparative environmental impact analyses for all existing RES based power plants are tabulated for various attributes. These attributes include but are not limited to human health, noise, pollution, greenhouse gas emission, ozone layer depletion, toxification, flooding, impact on inhabitants, eutrophication, dried up rivers, and deforestation. Based on the analysis, it is found that careful selection of RES for electrical power plants is necessary because improper utilization of RES could be very harmful for the environment.",renew energi sourc re base electr power plant wide consid green clean due contribut decarbon energi sector appar re produc carbon dioxid howev signific neg impact environ still found ignor paper environment impact re base power plant analyz comprehens review consid solar thermal solar photovolta wind biomass geotherm hydroelectr tidal ocean current ocean wave ocean thermal osmot effect solar thermal power well known concentr solar power strength weak opportun threat swot analysi carri discuss re base power plant compar swot analysi solar photovolta concentr solar power plant present compar environment impact analysi exist re base power plant tabul variou attribut attribut includ limit human health nois pollut greenhous ga emiss ozon layer deplet toxif flood impact inhabit eutroph dri river deforest base analysi found care select re electr power plant necessari improp util re could harm environ,0
Bacterial Growth-Induced Tobramycin Smart Release Self-Healing Hydrogel for Pseudomonas aeruginosa-Infected Burn Wound Healing,"To extract the maximum power from solar PV, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers are needed to operate the PV arrays at their maximum power point under varying environmental conditions. Fractional Open Circuit Voltage (FOCV) is a simple, cost-effective, and easy to implement MPPT technique. However, it suffers from the discontinuous power supply and low tracking efficiency. To overcome these drawbacks, a new hybrid MPPT technique based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and FOCV is proposed. The proposed technique is based on a single decision variable, reducing the complexity and convergence time of the algorithm. MATLAB/Simulink is used to test the robustness of the proposed technique under uniform and non-uniform irradiance conditions. The performance is compared to the Perturb & Observe, Incremental Conductance, and other hybrid MPPT techniques. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed technique is also assessed against a commercial PV system’s power output over one day. The results demonstrate that the proposed GA-FOCV technique improves the efficiency of the conventional FOCV method by almost 3%, exhibiting an average tracking efficiency of 99.96% and tracking speed of around 0.07 s with minimal steady-state oscillations. Additionally, the proposed technique can also efficiently track the global MPP under partial shading conditions and offers faster tracking speed, higher efficiency, and fewer oscillations than other hybrid MPPT techniques.",extract maximum power solar pv maximum power point track mppt control need oper pv array maximum power point vari environment condit fraction open circuit voltag focv simpl cost effect easi implement mppt techniqu howev suffer discontinu power suppli low track effici overcom drawback new hybrid mppt techniqu base genet algorithm ga focv propos propos techniqu base singl decis variabl reduc complex converg time algorithm matlab simulink use test robust propos techniqu uniform non uniform irradi condit perform compar perturb observ increment conduct hybrid mppt techniqu furthermor efficaci propos techniqu also assess commerci pv system power output one day result demonstr propos ga focv techniqu improv effici convent focv method almost exhibit averag track effici track speed around minim steadi state oscil addit propos techniqu also effici track global mpp partial shade condit offer faster track speed higher effici fewer oscil hybrid mppt techniqu,0
The economics and the environmental benignity of different colors of hydrogen,"Due to the increasing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as due to the rapidly increasing use of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation over the last years, interest in hydrogen is rising again. Hydrogen can be used as a storage for renewable energy balancing the whole energy systems, and contributing to the decarbonization of the energy system, especially of the industry and the transport sector. The major objective of this paper is to discuss various ways of hydrogen production depending on the primary energy sources used. Moreover, the economic and environ- mental performance of three major hydrogen colors, as well as major barriers for faster deployment in fuel cell vehicles, are analyzed. The major conclusion is that the full environmental beneﬁts of hydrogen use are highly dependent on the hydrogen production methods and primary sources used. Only green hydrogen with electricity from wind, PV and hydro has truly low emissions. All other sources like blue hydrogen with CCUS or electrolysis using the electricity grid have sub- stantially higher emissions, coming close to grey hydrogen production. Another conclusion is that it is important to introduce an international market for hydrogen to lower costs and to produce hydrogen where conditions are best. Finally, the major open question remaining is whether e including all external costs of all energy carriers, hydrogen of any color may become economically competitive in any sector of the energy system. The future success of hydrogen is very dependent on tech- nological development and resulting cost reductions, as well as on future priorities and the corresponding policy framework. The policy framework should support the shift from grey to green hydrogen.",due increas greenhous ga emiss well due rapidli increas use renew energi sourc electr gener last year interest hydrogen rise hydrogen use storag renew energi balanc whole energi system contribut decarbon energi system especi industri transport sector major object paper discu variou way hydrogen product depend primari energi sourc use moreov econom environ mental perform three major hydrogen color well major barrier faster deploy fuel cell vehicl analyz major conclus full environment beneﬁt hydrogen use highli depend hydrogen product method primari sourc use green hydrogen electr wind pv hydro truli low emiss sourc like blue hydrogen ccu electrolysi use electr grid sub stantial higher emiss come close grey hydrogen product anoth conclus import introduc intern market hydrogen lower cost produc hydrogen condit best final major open question remain whether e includ extern cost energi carrier hydrogen color may becom econom competit sector energi system futur success hydrogen depend tech nolog develop result cost reduct well futur prioriti correspond polici framework polici framework support shift grey green hydrogen,2

Semi-supervised adversarial discriminative learning approach for intelligent fault diagnosis of wind turbine,"Keywords: Wind turbine Data-driven Intelligent diagnosis Semi-supervised adversarial learning Metric learning Wind turbines play a crucial role in renewable energy generation systems and are frequently exposed to challenging operational environments. Monitoring and diagnosing potential faults during their operation is essential for improving reliability and reducing maintenance costs. Supervised learning using data-driven techniques, particularly deep learning, oﬀers a viable approach for developing fault diagnosis models. However, a signiﬁcant challenge in practical wind power equipment lies in the scarcity of annotated samples required to train these models eﬀectively. This paper proposes a semi-supervised fault diagnosis approach speciﬁcally designed for wind turbines, aiming to address this challenge. Initially, a semi-supervised deep neural network is constructed using adversarial learning, where a limited set of annotated samples is used in conjunction with a vast amount of unannotated samples. The health status features present in the unannotated samples are leveraged to capture a generalized representation of the underlying features. Subsequently, a metric learning-guided discriminative features enhancement technique is employed to improve the separability of diﬀerent manifolds, thereby enhancing the performance of the semi-supervised training process. By employing this methodology, it becomes possible to develop a fault diagnosis model with superior accuracy using only a limited amount of annotated samples. Comprehensive fault diagnosis experiments were conducted on a wind turbine fault dataset, revealing the eﬃcacy and superiority of the presented methodology.",keyword wind turbin data driven intellig diagnosi semi supervis adversari learn metric learn wind turbin play crucial role renew energi gener system frequent expos challeng oper environ monitor diagnos potenti fault oper essenti improv reliabl reduc mainten cost supervis learn use data driven techniqu particularli deep learn oﬀer viabl approach develop fault diagnosi model howev signiﬁc challeng practic wind power equip lie scarciti annot sampl requir train model eﬀect paper propos semi supervis fault diagnosi approach speciﬁc design wind turbin aim address challeng initi semi supervis deep neural network construct use adversari learn limit set annot sampl use conjunct vast amount unannot sampl health statu featur present unannot sampl leverag captur gener represent underli featur subsequ metric learn guid discrimin featur enhanc techniqu employ improv separ diﬀer manifold therebi enhanc perform semi supervis train process employ methodolog becom possibl develop fault diagnosi model superior accuraci use limit amount annot sampl comprehens fault diagnosi experi conduct wind turbin fault dataset reveal eﬃcaci superior present methodolog,0
Model Predictive Current Control of Nine-Phase Open-End Winding PMSMs With an Online Virtual Vector Synthesis Strategy,"—The current error is hard to avoid for ﬁnite control set model predictive current control (FCS-MPCC) in nine-phase open-end winding permanent magnet syn- chronous motors. To overcome this problem, an online vir- tual voltage vector (V3) synthesis strategy is proposed in this article. First, a group of V3 s without harmonic voltage components are designed as the basic vectors for online synthesis. Then, two adjacent basic V3 s and a zero vector are used to synthesize a new V3, which can output arbi- trary amplitude and phase angle in the fundamental space. The two basic V3 s are directly selected from the located sector of the predicted reference voltage vector (RVV), and their duration ratio can be simply calculated according to the angle of the RVV in the sector. In this way, the zero error is realized between the new V3 and RVV. Moreover, an online pulse generation algorithm corresponding to the new V3 is proposed, which can calculate the symmetrical pulse sequences in real-time for the multiphase OW drive system without the space vector modulator. Finally, exper- imental results have veriﬁed the effectiveness and superi- ority of the proposed strategy, in comparison to existing FCS-MPCC in multiphase OW motor drive systems.

"Risk-constrained stochastic scheduling for energy hub: Integrating renewables, demand response, and electric vehicles","This research introduces a stochastic scheduling approach that incorporates risk constraints for an energy hub (EH), considering uncertainties related to renewable generation and load demands. The proposed method utilizes the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) technique to assess and quantify risks. By striking a balance between reducing operational and emissions costs and increasing risk aversion, the approach presents a trade-off. The EH comprises various components such as a wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV) cells, a fuel cell power plant (FCPP), a combined heat and power generation unit (CHP), and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Uncertain variables encompass factors such as wind speed, solar irradiation, different demands, and market prices. To optimize profits and enhance the consumption curve, demand response programs (DRPs) for electrical, thermal, and cooling demands are implemented. To address the uncertainties associated with input random variables, the efficient k-means data clustering method is employed. A new slime mold algorithm, based on coughing and chaos theory, has been proposed to enhance the problem’s solution. The algorithm incorporates innovative operators to improve its capabilities. By utilizing the coughing mechanism and chaos theory, the algorithm explores the solution space more effectively, resulting in improved outcomes for the problem at hand. The results demonstrate significant flexibility in EH management and are extensively discussed. Simulation results indicate that inte­ grating PEVs, FCPP, and DRPs can lead to reductions of 2 %, 7 %, and 11 % in the EH’s operating costs, respectively. Furthermore, considering PEVs, FCPP, and DRPs can improve the EH’s risk cost by 1.98 %, 6.7 %, and 10.5 %, respectively. Based on the numerical results, in Case 4 led to a remarkable 12.65 % reduction in operational costs while simultaneously achieving a 15.43 % decrease in emission costs, showcasing the effec­ tiveness of the proposed approach in optimizing energy management in an energy hub system.",research introduc stochast schedul approach incorpor risk constraint energi hub eh consid uncertainti relat renew gener load demand propos method util condit valu risk cvar techniqu ass quantifi risk strike balanc reduc oper emiss cost increas risk avers approach present trade eh compris variou compon wind turbin wt photovolta pv cell fuel cell power plant fcpp combin heat power gener unit chp plug electr vehicl pev uncertain variabl encompass factor wind speed solar irradi differ demand market price optim profit enhanc consumpt curv demand respons program drp electr thermal cool demand implement address uncertainti associ input random variabl effici k mean data cluster method employ new slime mold algorithm base cough chao theori propos enhanc problem solut algorithm incorpor innov oper improv capabl util cough mechan chao theori algorithm explor solut space effect result improv outcom problem hand result demonstr signific flexibl eh manag extens discuss simul result indic int grate pev fcpp drp lead reduct eh oper cost respect furthermor consid pev fcpp drp improv eh risk cost respect base numer result case led remark reduct oper cost simultan achiev decreas emiss cost showcas effec tive propos approach optim energi manag energi hub system,0
