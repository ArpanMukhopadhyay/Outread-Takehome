Recent advances in ammonia synthesis technologies: Toward future zero carbon emissions,"
                  As a carbon-free molecule, ammonia has gained great global interest in being considered a significant future candidate for the transition toward renewable energy. Numerous applications of ammonia as a fuel have been developed for energy generation, heavy transportation, and clean, distributed energy storage. There is a clear global target to achieve a sustainable economy and carbon neutrality. Therefore, most of the research's efforts are concentrated on generating cost-effective renewable energy on a large scale rather than fossil fuels. However, storage and transportation are still roadblocks for these technologies, for example, hydrogen technologies. Ammonia could be replaced as a viable fuel for a clean and sustainable future of global energy. More efforts from governments and scientists can lead to making ammonia a clean energy vector in most energy applications. In this review, ammonia synthesis was assessed, including conventional Haber–Bosch technology. Current hydrogen technologies as the key parameters for ammonia generation are also evaluated. The role of ammonia as a hydrogen-based fuel and generation roadmap are discussed for future utilization of energy mix. Further, ammonia generation processes are addressed in depth, including blue and green ammonia generation. A survey of ammonia synthesis catalytic materials was conducted and the role of catalyst materials in ammonia generation was compared, which showed that the Ru-based catalyst generated the maximum ammonia after 20 h of starting experiment. An end-use plan for using ammonia as a clean energy fuel in vehicles, marines, gas turbines as well as fuel cells, is briefly discussed to recognize the potential applications of ammonia use. The practical and future end-use vision of energy sources is proposed to achieve great benefits at low carbon emissions and costs. This review can provide prospective knowledge of large-scale aspects and environmental considerations of ammonia. Herein, we conclude that ammonia will become the “clean energy carrier link” that will achieve the global energy and economy sustainability targets.

Co doping regulating electronic structure of Bi2MoO6 to construct dual active sites for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation,"
                  Although photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) is a green ammonia synthesis technology, it still encounters low adsorption/activation efficiency of N2 and lack of reaction active sites. Element doping is an efficient strategy to regulate electronic structure of catalyst. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the effect of doping elements on the N2 adsorption/activation, reaction active site and energy barriers is not well unraveled. Taking Co doped Bi2MoO6 (Co-Bi2MoO6) as a model photocatalyst, density functional theory (DFT) and experiment study were used to investigate the mechanism of Co doping on the PNRR performance over Bi2MoO6. DFT results reveal that Co doping regulates the electronic structure, activates Bi sites of Co-Bi2MoO6 and provides new Co active sites, thus constructing dual active sites for PNRR. Benefited from dual active sites for effectively adsorption/activation N2, the as-fabricated 3% Co-Bi2MoO6 exhibit the maximum NH3 generation rate of 95.5 μmol·g−1·h−1 without sacrificial agents, which is 7.2 times that of Bi2MoO6. Furthermore, the detail mechanism of NN bond adsorption/activation and hydrogenation reaction on Co-Bi2MoO6 was also proposed according to in-situ FTIR and DFT results. This study provides a promising strategy to design catalysts with dual active sites for PNRR, which is of great significance to the popularization of other material systems.

"A Prompt Decarbonization Pathway for Shipping: Green Hydrogen, Ammonia, and Methanol Production and Utilization in Marine Engines","<jats:p>The shipping industry has reached a higher level of maturity in terms of its knowledge and awareness of decarbonization challenges. Carbon-free or carbon-neutralized green fuel, such as green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol, are being widely discussed. However, little attention has paid to the green fuel pathway from renewable energy to shipping. This paper, therefore, provides a review of the production methods for green power (green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol) and analyzes the potential of green fuel for application to shipping. The review shows that the potential production methods for green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol for the shipping industry are (1) hydrogen production from seawater electrolysis using green power; (2) ammonia production from green hydrogen + Haber–Bosch process; and (3) methanol production from CO2 using green power. While the future of green fuel is bright, in the short term, the costs are expected to be higher than conventional fuel. Our recommendations are therefore as follows: improve green power production technology to reduce the production cost; develop electrochemical fuel production technology to increase the efficiency of green fuel production; and explore new technology. Strengthening the research and development of renewable energy and green fuel production technology and expanding fuel production capacity to ensure an adequate supply of low- and zero-emission marine fuel are important factors to achieve carbon reduction in shipping.</jats:p>"
Utilization of green ammonia as a hydrogen energy carrier for decarbonization in spark ignition engines,"
                  Rising concerns about the dependence of modern energy systems on fossil fuels have raised the requirement for green alternate fuels to pave the roadmap for a sustainable energy future with a carbon-free economy. Massive expectations of hydrogen as an enabler for decarbonization of the energy sector are limited by the lack of required infrastructure, whose implementation is affected by the issues related to the storage and distribution of hydrogen energy. Ammonia is an effective hydrogen energy carrier with a well-established and mature infrastructure for long-distance transportation and distribution. The possibility for green ammonia production from renewable energy sources has made it a suitable green alternate fuel for the decarbonization of the automotive and power generation sectors. In this work, engine characteristics for ammonia combustion in spark ignition engines have been reported with a detailed note on engines fuelled with pure ammonia as well as blends of ammonia with gasoline, hydrogen, and methane. Higher auto-ignition temperature, low flammability, and lower flame speed of ammonia have a detrimental effect on engine characteristics, and it could be addressed either by incorporating engine modifications or by enhancing the fuel quality. Literature shows that the increase in compression ratio from 9.4:1 to 11.5:1 improved the maximum power by 59% and the addition of 10% hydrogen in supercharged conditions improved the indicated efficiency by 37%. Challenges and strategies for the utilization of ammonia as combustible fuel in engines are discussed by considering the need for technical advancements as well as social acceptance. Energy efficiency for green ammonia production is also discussed with a due note on techniques for direct synthesis of ammonia from air and water.

Techno-economic assessment of green hydrogen and ammonia production from wind and solar energy in Iran,"
                  This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potential green hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strong wind and solar resources. The study was organized in five steps. First, regarding the wind density and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. All these locations are inland spots, but since the produced ammonia is planned to be exported, it must be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen production facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis requires a considerable amount of water with specific quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this regard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study intends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, hydrogen, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using satellite images, and takes into account all pump/compression stations required to transport these media. This study provides a realistic cost of green hydrogen/ammonia production in Iran, which is ready to be exported, considering all related processes involved in the hydrogen supply chain.

Estimating global production and supply costs for green hydrogen and hydrogen-based green energy commodities,"
                  Green energy commodities are expected to be central in decarbonising the global energy system. Such green energy commodities could be hydrogen or other hydrogen-based energy commodities produced from renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar or wind energy. We quantify the production cost and potentials of hydrogen and hydrogen-based energy commodities ammonia, methane, methanol, gasoline, diesel and kerosene in 113 countries. Moreover, we evaluate total supply costs to Germany, considering both pipeline-based and maritime transport. We determine production costs by optimising the investment and operation of commodity production from dedicated RES based on country-level RES potentials and country-specific weighted average costs of capital. Analysing the geographic distribution of production and supply costs, we find that production costs dominate the supply cost composition for liquid or easily liquefiable commodities, while transport costs dominate for gaseous commodities. In the case of Germany, importing green ammonia could be more cost-efficient than domestic production from locally produced or imported hydrogen. Green ammonia could be supplied to Germany from many regions worldwide at below the cost of domestic production, with costs ranging from 624 to 874 $/t NH3 and Norway being the cheapest supplier. Ammonia production using imported hydrogen from Spain could be cost-effective if a pan-European hydrogen pipeline grid based on repurposed natural gas pipelines exists.

"A Perspective on the Overarching Role of Hydrogen, Ammonia, and Methanol Carbon-Neutral Fuels towards Net Zero Emission in the Next Three Decades","<jats:p>Arguably, one of the most important issues the world is facing currently is climate change. At the current rate of fossil fuel consumption, the world is heading towards extreme levels of global temperature rise if immediate actions are not taken. Transforming the current energy system from one largely based on fossil fuels to a carbon-neutral one requires unprecedented speed. Based on the current state of development, direct electrification of the future energy system alone is technically challenging and not enough, especially in hard-to-abate sectors like heavy industry, road trucking, international shipping, and aviation. This leaves a considerable demand for alternative carbon-neutral fuels such as green ammonia and hydrogen and renewable methanol. From this perspective, we discuss the overarching roles of each fuel in reaching net zero emission within the next three decades. The challenges and future directions associated with the fuels conclude the current perspective paper.</jats:p>"
The economics of global green ammonia trade - Shipping Australian wind and sunshine to Germany,"This paper contributes to understanding the transformation of global energy trade to green energy carriers, focusing on green ammonia as the foreseeable first green hydrogen carrier. We provide a comprehensive overview of today's ammonia trade and assess scaling options for the trade of green ammonia. To that aim, we develop an optimization model for the integrated assessment of the green ammonia value chain that covers all steps from green ammonia production in an exporting country, up to delivery to a harbor in an importing country. The model endogenously chooses among different technology options and determines cost minimal operation. In a case study, we apply the model to the large-scale import of ammonia from Australia to Germany in a scenario for 2030. The results show that green ammonia can reach cost parity with gray ammonia even for moderate gas prices (but not necessarily with blue ammonia) if CO2 prices are high enough. We also provide a sensitivity analysis with respect to the interest rate and other key technical and economic parameters and show that cracking ammonia to provide pure hydrogen comes at a 45% cost markup per MWh at the destination."
Techno-economic evaluation of hydrogen and ammonia as energy carriers in a multi-generation system,"
                  Green hydrogen is suitable for grid-scale energy storage to increase the penetration of renewable energy, and it is also an alternative to fossil fuels. However, it still suffers from storage problems owing to its low volumetric energy density, embrittlement, and very low boiling point. To improve safety and reduce cost, green ammonia has been proposed as a substitute for hydrogen and has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a multi-generation system was proposed to compare green hydrogen and green ammonia as energy carriers. Four scenarios are discussed and the performances under different energy carriers, constant and time-of-use electricity prices, and on-grid and off-grid operations are compared. The optimal planning of the system was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and was evaluated using supply and demand profiles hourly over a year. The objective was to maximize profitability, which is reflected by the cumulative cash position and payback period. The results revealed that the hydrogen-based system was superior to the ammonia-based system. In the hydrogen-based scenario, the cumulative cash position was 83.43 MUSD and the payback period was 14 years. The cumulative cash position and payback period were 12.78 MUSD and 22 years, respectively, in the ammonia-based scenario. To improve profitability, it is recommended to increase the capacity for hydrogen/ammonia production and reduce the capacity for backup power generation.

The properties of batteries are ideal for most electrical energy storage (EES) needs, yet, faced with resource constraints, the ability of current lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) to match this overwhelming demand is uncertain.

                  Electrical energy storage (EES) exploiting secondary battery technologies is ideal for large-scale energy storage needs due to the rapid growth in proliferation of renewable energy sources and the emerging markets of grid-scale battery applications. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), a more sustainable EES option alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), have attracted intensive interests over the past decade, because of the natural abundance, evenly geographical-distributed Na-source, significantly low cost, and environmental benignity. Polyanionic compounds offer an appealing combination of rich structural diversity, superior ionic conductivity, high structural and thermal stability, and convenient storage/handling, making them competitive and attractive candidate electrode materials for next generation energy storage systems. In this review, recent advancements made regarding polyanion-type electrodes used for SIBs are summarized, elaborating their intrinsic structural characteristics, electrochemical properties, and corresponding sodium-storage mechanisms. Furthermore, we highlight the recent achievements in the lab-scale Na-ion full-cell prototypes that consist of polyanion-type compounds as one or both working electrodes. Last but not least, challenges and outlooks on further optimization of the structure and the electrochemical performance of polyanion-type electrode materials for SIBs are also presented to provide some insights to facilitate the practical realization of sodium-ion technologies.

Assessing new transmission and energy storage in achieving increasing renewable generation targets in a regional grid,"
                  This study evaluates generation, transmission, and storage capacity needs to achieve deep renewable energy penetration in a regional electricity grid with an average load of approximately 20 GW. Increasing renewable energy targets are analyzed to evaluate the effects of realistic regional transmission upgrade and energy storage cost assumptions on the cost-optimal mix of generation, transmission, and storage capacity. Contextual data is used for New York State’s grid to examine how electricity generation from renewable energy resources (wind, water, and solar power) can meet between 50% and 80% of electricity demand. A central finding of the study is that when realistic transmission upgrade costs are assumed, new interzonal transmission and battery storage are not needed to cost effectively meet near-term renewable energy goals. In fact, New York can achieve 50% renewable energy penetration with only a buildout of new generation capacity: Onshore wind (13.7 GW), offshore wind (4.1 GW), and solar photovoltaics (3 GW). The presence of grid-scale battery storage, electric vehicles, or additional behind-the-meter solar capacity does not markedly change the model-selected generation mix. To achieve the 50% target, we compute a $52/MWh levelized cost of electricity for new renewable energy, which is in line with current generation costs.
                  As the renewable generation target increases beyond 50%, the model begins to select transmission upgrades and new storage capacity, the latter particularly if battery costs continue to decline as anticipated. At deeper targets, marginal generation capacity would otherwise experience high curtailment primarily due to supply–demand imbalances; we calculate the value of energy storage at a 65% renewable energy penetration level to be 2.5–3 times higher than its value at a 50% level. However, the additional storage and generation – and transmission, to a lesser degree – needed to achieve longer-term renewable energy goals lead to a substantial rise in total investment. Between 50% and 55% targets, the computed marginal levelized cost of electricity for new variable renewable energy is $94/MWh, compared to $592/MWh between 75% and 80%, suggesting alternative integration measures are likely necessary at such high penetration rates.

Using electrolytic hydrogen production and energy storage for balancing a low carbon electricity grid: Scenario assessments for India,"
                  Nuclear reactors and variable renewables will play a significant role in the global energy transition as providers of low carbon electricity to various end use sectors. Real time balancing of power demand and supply without modulation or curtailment is possible using electrolytic hydrogen plants and energy storage systems. The generation mix adopted and load profiles are unique to a country and this study considers the specific case of India. This work analyses the use of grid connected water electrolysers, grid scale battery storage, hydrogen storage and fuel cells as flexible loads and dispatch schemes for grid balancing. Based on postulated long term power generation scenarios for India, the minimum required system sizes for grid balancing are estimated and techno-economic uncertainties are assessed. The use of water electrolysers is prioritized to make use of excess power, while minimizing battery storage requirement. This scheme can potentially produce a substantial share of low carbon hydrogen in India for use in industrial decarbonization, thus reducing the need for additional generation infrastructure.

Performance Evaluation Of Grid-scale Battery Energy Storage System Employing Virtual Synchronous Generator Control For Grid Code Compliance In Weak Grids,
Early prediction of battery degradation in grid-scale battery energy storage system using extreme gradient boosting algorithm,"The growth of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is caused by the variability and intermittent nature of high demand and renewable power generation at the network scale. In the context of BESS, Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery occupies a crucial position, although it is faced with challenges related to performance battery degradation over time due to electrochemical processes. This battery degradation is a crucial factor to account for, based on its potential to diminish the efficiency and safety of electrical system equipment, thereby contributing to increased system planning costs. This implies that the health of battery needs to be diagnosed, particularly by determining remaining useful life (RUL), to avoid unexpected operational costs and ensure system safety. Therefore, this study aimed to use machine learning models, specifically extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, to estimate RUL, with a focus on the temperature variable, an aspect that had been previously underemphasized. Utilizing XGBoost model, along with fine-tuning its hyperparameters, proved to be a more accurate and efficient method for predicting RUL. The evaluation of the model yielded promising outcomes, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 90.1 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7.5 %. Additionally, the results showed that the model could improve RUL predictions for batteries within BESS. This study significantly contributed to optimizing planning and operations for BESS, as well as developing more efficient and effective maintenance strategies."
Optimal day-ahead large-scale battery dispatch model for multi-regulation participation considering full timescale uncertainties,"
                  Grid scale battery integration plays an important role in renewable energy integration and the formation of smart grid. To mitigate the problems of insufficient frequency response and peak regulation capacities faced by modern power grids with high wind energy uptake, a day-ahead optimization dispatch strategy considering operational risks is proposed in this study. In the day-ahead dispatch model, generation units and a large-scale battery energy storage station (LS-BESS) are coordinated to participate in multi-type frequency control ancillary services (FCASs). For optimal performance, scheduling in different timescales and the complementarity between power and energy types of requirements are coordinated, with various service uncertainties considered. Then the conditional value-at-risk theory is utilized to achieve the optimal mix of multiple resources for day-ahead regulation reserves, to realize the minimum operation cost. To tackle the uncertainty of wind power over a large timescale, a robust optimization (RO) approach based on the budget uncertainty set is employed, which considers robustness and economy. This can help avoid over-conservation of the standard RO and enhance the applicability of the decisions made. Simulation studies and comparison analysis of multiple schemes verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimal day-ahead dispatch strategy, which also demonstrate that a LS-BESS participating in multiple FCASs for day-ahead dispatch can help realize secure, reliable, and economic power grid.

Optimal Grid Flexibility Assessment for Integration of Variable Renewable-Based Electricity Generation,"<jats:p>This study delves into power system flexibility, with a keen focus on the integration of variable renewable electricity generation into power grids. Two scenarios were analyzed. The base scenario revealed an aging grid, insufficient generation capacity, frequent outages, and little renewable energy generation (1.9%), along with a significant (71.23%) loss of load. In contrast, the investment scenario presented solutions including raising VRE capacity to 44%, adding 1000 MW capacity transmission lines, installing 200 MW capacity grid-scale battery storage, and technological enhancements. These interventions effectively eliminated loss of load, reinforcing energy resilience. Investments in CCGPP and grid-scale batteries proved instrumental in mitigating the variability of renewable energy. Improved transmission promised efficient power exchange and regional collaboration. The elimination of annualized energy spills and the removal of ramping constraints marked significant strides in enhancing power system flexibility. This research underscores the pivotal role of grid flexibility in accommodating VRE sources. By implementing the proposed optimal solutions, Afghanistan can lead the way toward a cleaner, more resilient, and more interconnected energy future. These findings offer a replicable framework for addressing similar challenges in integrating renewable energy sources globally and supporting the transition to sustainable and reliable energy.</jats:p>"

Using chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the film formation is shown to depend on the electrode material (W, Mo, Ta, or glassy carbon), as well as the Lewis acidity and molar ratio of I<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>/I<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>

A review of solar hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors and systems,"In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in hybrid PV-T collectors and the wider systems within which they can be implemented, and assess the worldwide energy and carbon mitigation potential of these systems. We cover both experimental and computational studies, identify opportunities for performance enhancement, pathways for collector innovation, and implications of their wider deployment at the solar-generation system level. First, we classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air–water, heat-pipe, building integrated and concentrated PV-T collectors. This is followed by a presentation of performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we address wider PV-T systems and their applications, comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S–CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S–CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying and solar for hydrogen production systems. This includes a specific review of potential performance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar-generation system level in thermal energy storage, control and demand-side management. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed to analyse their carbon mitigation potential and how this technology might fit within pathways for global decarbonization. It is estimated that the REmap baseline emission curve can be reduced by more than 16% in 2030 if the uptake of solar PV-T technologies can be promoted. Finally, the review turns to a critical examination of key challenges for the adoption of PV-T technology and recommendations."
"A review on global warming potential, challenges and opportunities of renewable hydrogen production technologies","
                  This review compares global warming potential of renewable hydrogen production technologies including wind- and solar PV-powered water electrolysis, biomass gasification and biogas reforming based on 64 hydrogen production cases compiled from the literature. Unlike many previous studies, this review discusses the cases from various countries, while selecting the production technologies that have potential of commercialisation. Among the four reviewed technologies, wind electrolysis performed the best in global warming impacts (1.29 kg CO2 eq/kg H2), whereas biogas reforming technology performed the worst (3.61 kg CO2 eq/kg H2). Key factors that contributed to most of the impacts were found to be materials used for construction of wind- and solar- electricity generation system for both wind- and solar PV-powered electrolysis, and energy consumption during gasification processes for biomass gasification, while methane leakage during biogas production had the highest contribution to the impacts of biogas reforming cases. On average, the renewable hydrogen cases demonstrated 68–92% lower global warming potential when compared to conventional coal gasification and natural gas steam methane reforming systems. Increasing demand for renewable hydrogen and possibility of hydrogen being integrated into existing natural gas networks highlight the important role of renewable hydrogen production in the future.

Weather Impact on Solar Farm Performance: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques,"<jats:p>Forecasting the performance and energy yield of photovoltaic (PV) farms is crucial for establishing the economic sustainability of a newly installed system. The present study aims to develop a prediction model to forecast an installed PV system’s annual power generation yield and performance ratio (PR) using three environmental input parameters: solar irradiance, wind speed, and ambient air temperature. Three data-based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), response surface methodology (RSM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were employed. The models were developed using three years of data from an operational 2MWp Solar PV Project at Kuzhalmannam, Kerala state, India. Statistical indices such as Pearson’s R, coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSCE), mean absolute-percentage error (MAPE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), Taylor’s diagram, and correlation matrix were used to determine the most accurate prediction model. The results demonstrate that ANFIS was the most precise performance ratio prediction model, with an R2 value of 0.9830 and an RMSE of 0.6. It is envisaged that the forecast model would be a valuable tool for policymakers, solar energy researchers, and solar farm developers.</jats:p>"

Generation of green hydrogen using self-sustained regenerative fuel cells: Opportunities and challenges,"
                  The ever-increasing energy demand, depleting fossil fuel reserves, and rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions have necessitated the transition towards the generation of green and clean energy through renewable energy sources. Solar energy is one such renewable energy source that has received significant attention owing to its abundance and inexhaustibility. However, solar energy alone cannot replace fossil fuels in the energy portfolio. There exists a need to develop another clean energy source that can potentially act as an alternative to conventional fuels. Hydrogen proves to be an ideal candidate in this domain and can be sustainably generated by water electrolysis by powering the electrolyzer using solar energy. The hydrogen thus synthesized has net zero carbon emissions and is a suitable asset for decarbonizing the environment. This review encompasses the generation of hydrogen using PV-Electrolyzer systems and addresses the challenges associated with the same. Overcoming these drawbacks can ensure a strong position for hydrogen as an alternative fuel in the energy infrastructure. By employing electrolyzers that are fueled by renewable energy and then using that hydrogen to feed a fuel cell, this study aims to clarify the potential and constraints of producing green hydrogen. Since this area of research has not yet been fully investigated, a review article that enables and encourages academics to develop original solutions is urgently needed.

Design and investigation of PV string/central architecture for bayesian fusion technique using grey wolf optimization and flower pollination optimized algorithm,"
                  One of the most essential factors in the current study is effectively harvesting the Maximum Power Extraction (MPE) from the Photovoltaic (PV) panel. The primary difficulties in extracting solar power is occurrence of partial shading which causes the panel to significantly increases power loss. These will mainly occur due to when partially shaded solar PV array kept under certain critical conditions for obtaining maximum output power. Many researcher have suggested by connecting bypass diodes in anti-parallel to the PV modules hotspots in the modules can be avoided. Out of all techniques, the proposed Bayesian Fusion Technique (BFT) is a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) techniques to optimize the performance of solar panels in photovoltaic (PV) systems. The combination of GWO and FPA forms an ideal combination that is beneficial for optimizing the performance of PV systems is determined in this work. In this study real 6*6 PV array string and irregular PV array configuration such as central and parallel-series PV string combination of various partial shading pattern is compared and found to be effective for reducing the hotspots problems. The performance of these configuration under different shading patterns have been compared and analyzed with the different parameters like output power, conversion efficiency and tracking efficiency. This article state about the influence of partial darkening and the crucial point that reduce the sensitivity to shading heaviness. For better understanding for reader the MATLAB/Simulink software is used to validate the simulation result with real time data. Overall, this article states the BFT is an efficient and reliable approach to improve the efficiency of PV systems, by combining two optimization techniques like GWO and FPA hybrid algorithm. This article gives clear insight to the researchers for choosing BFT-GWO algorithm in order to decrease the cost and wastage of energy for achieving better solar panel performance.

An improved genetic algorithm based fractional open circuit voltage MPPT for solar PV systems,"To extract the maximum power from solar PV, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers are needed to operate the PV arrays at their maximum power point under varying environmental conditions. Fractional Open Circuit Voltage (FOCV) is a simple, cost-effective, and easy to implement MPPT technique. However, it suffers from the discontinuous power supply and low tracking efficiency. To overcome these drawbacks, a new hybrid MPPT technique based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and FOCV is proposed. The proposed technique is based on a single decision variable, reducing the complexity and convergence time of the algorithm. MATLAB/Simulink is used to test the robustness of the proposed technique under uniform and non-uniform irradiance conditions. The performance is compared to the Perturb & Observe, Incremental Conductance, and other hybrid MPPT techniques. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed technique is also assessed against a commercial PV system’s power output over one day. The results demonstrate that the proposed GA-FOCV technique improves the efficiency of the conventional FOCV method by almost 3%, exhibiting an average tracking efficiency of 99.96% and tracking speed of around 0.07 s with minimal steady-state oscillations. Additionally, the proposed technique can also efficiently track the global MPP under partial shading conditions and offers faster tracking speed, higher efficiency, and fewer oscillations than other hybrid MPPT techniques."
"Solar Energy: Applications, Trends Analysis, Bibliometric Analysis and Research Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","<jats:p>Over the past decade, energy demand has witnessed a drastic increase, mainly due to huge development in the industry sector and growing populations. This has led to the global utilization of renewable energy resources and technologies to meet this high demand, as fossil fuels are bound to end and are causing harm to the environment. Solar PV (photovoltaic) systems are a renewable energy technology that allows the utilization of solar energy directly from the sun to meet electricity demands. Solar PV has the potential to create a reliable, clean and stable energy systems for the future. This paper discusses the different types and generations of solar PV technologies available, as well as several important applications of solar PV systems, which are “Large-Scale Solar PV”, “Residential Solar PV”, “Green Hydrogen”, “Water Desalination” and “Transportation”. This paper also provides research on the number of solar papers and their applications that relate to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the years between 2011 and 2021. A total of 126,513 papers were analyzed. The results show that 72% of these papers are within SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. This shows that there is a lack of research in solar energy regarding the SDGs, especially SDG 1: No Poverty, SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 10: Reduced Inequality and SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.

Techno-economic assessment of green hydrogen and ammonia production from wind and solar energy in Iran,"
                  This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potential green hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strong wind and solar resources. The study was organized in five steps. First, regarding the wind density and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. All these locations are inland spots, but since the produced ammonia is planned to be exported, it must be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen production facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis requires a considerable amount of water with specific quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this regard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study intends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, hydrogen, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using satellite images, and takes into account all pump/compression stations required to transport these media. This study provides a realistic cost of green hydrogen/ammonia production in Iran, which is ready to be exported, considering all related processes involved in the hydrogen supply chain.

Synergies and potential of hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal desalination technologies,"Solar desalination has emerged as a sustainable solution for addressing global water scarcity in the energy-water nexus, particularly for remote areas in developing countries. How to use the light spectrum through solar devices can profoundly affect the solar energy utilization, desalination rates, off-grid applicability, and water affordability. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal (ST) respectively have enabled a variety of interesting solar desalination technologies, but the resulting applications usually limit the integration between solar and desalination to be either electrically or thermally connected. Here this review paper explores smart co-uses of heat and electricity from the sun to improve the efficiency, productivity, and independence of various solar desalination processes. It is found that coupling solar photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) with desalination could be a practical and immediately deployable route for plausibly more sustainable solar desalination than current solutions, because the combined electrical and thermal energy outputs from PVT panels could be used synergistically to catalyze the improvement on the solar energy efficiency, specific energy consumption, and specific water production, as well as the operational independence for off-grid applications. Our preliminary analysis indicated an up to 20 % lower cost of PVT-desalination than current solar PV-desalination and ST-desalination but also with challenges discussed."
Research on the evolution of China's photovoltaic technology innovation network from the perspective of patents,"Photovoltaic (PV) technology, as a low-carbon energy technology, is crucial to mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable development. China has the largest total number of PV technology patents in the world, but the lack of core technologies has restricted the further innovative development of China's PV industry. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify China's current PV technology accumulation to better catch up with key technology areas. To clearly describe the structural characteristics of China's PV technology innovation network, this study uses China's patent PV technology data over the past 20 years from the Incopat global patent database and analyses the structural characteristics of the network from the perspectives of one-mode and two-mode networks, using method of social network analysis (SNA). The results show that 1) the leading PV enterprises have basically formed relatively stable internal collaborations and that the scale of innovation network development has expanded rapidly, with very strong stamina; 2) with the development of China's PV industry, many innovative PV techniques have been developed by leading enterprises in the field of innovation and research and development (R&D) of PV technology, and among patent applicants with strong collaboration, kinship collaboration with investment relationships is dominant; 3) provinces participating in PV technology innovation are increasing significantly, the network is more influenced by leading nodes, and the eastern coastal provinces are pioneers in the innovation and R&D of PV technology; and 4) PV technological innovation collaboration between patent applicants and cities has changed from local collaboration to cross-regional collaboration, high-value areas are basically concentrated in the eastern coastal region of China, with scattered spatial characteristics, and cross-regional collaboration presents a “triangular” spatial structure, with the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei as cores. The conclusions can provide patent information support for scientific research on energy conservation and emission reduction to achieve low-carbon goals, and can also provide reference for policy formulation of renewable energy development and green development strategies."

Wind speed forecasting based on the hybrid ensemble empirical mode decomposition and GA-BP neural network method,"
                  Wind speed is the major factor that affects the wind generation, and in turn the forecasting accuracy of wind speed is the key to wind power prediction. In this paper, a wind speed forecasting method based on improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and GA-BP neural network is proposed. EMD has been applied extensively for analyzing nonlinear stochastic signals. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is an improved method of EMD, which can effectively handle the mode-mixing problem and decompose the original data into more stationary signals with different frequencies. Each signal is taken as an input data to the GA-BP neural network model. The final forecasted wind speed data is obtained by aggregating the predicted data of individual signals. Cases study of a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China, shows that the proposed hybrid method is much more accurate than the traditional GA-BP forecasting approach and GA-BP with EMD and wavelet neural network method. By the sensitivity analysis of parameters, it can be seen that appropriate settings on parameters can improve the forecasting result. The simulation with MATLAB shows that the proposed method can improve the forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency, which make it suitable for on-line ultra-short term (10 min) and short term (1 h) wind speed forecasting.

ERA5: The new champion of wind power modelling?,"
                  Output from meteorological reanalyses are used extensively in both academia and industry for modelling wind power. Recently, the first batch of the new ERA5 reanalysis was released. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of ERA5 and MERRA-2 (a commonly used reanalysis today) in terms of modelling i) the aggregated wind generation in five different countries and ii) the generation for 1051 individual wind turbines in Sweden. The modelled wind power generation was compared to measurements. In conclusion, ERA5 performs better than MERRA-2 in all analysed aspects; correlations are higher, mean absolute and root mean square errors are in average around 20% lower and distributions of both hourly data and changes in hourly data are more similar to those for measurements. It is also shown that the uncertainty related to long-term correction (using one year of measurements and reanalysis data to predict the energy production during the remaining 1–5 years) is 20% lower for ERA5. In fact, using one year sample data and ERA5 gives slightly more accurate estimates than using two years of sample data and MERRA-2. Additionally, a new metric for quantifying the system size and dispersion of wind farms is proposed.

To verify the strength of the proposed technique, the results are compared with the results obtained from the standard software tool, hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. It has been verified from the results that the ABC algorithm has good convergence property and ability to provide good quality results. Further, for critical case such as the failure of any source, the behavior of the proposed system has been observed.

Real-Time Energy Storage Management for Renewable Integration in Microgrid: An Off-Line Optimization Approach,
Techno-economic optimization of hybrid photovoltaic/wind generation together with energy storage system in a stand-alone micro-grid subjected to demand response,"
                  Regarding the importance of supplying energy to regions that are far from power systems, this study is devoted to analyzing and modeling of a stand-alone micro-grid. In spite of many studies in the case of demand response programming for optimal management and operation cost reduction of the micro-grids, and regarding the importance of size optimization of micro-grids, this paper seeks to examine and investigate the ability of demand response programming in the case of component size optimization of a micro-grid. Due to deficiency or unavailability of dispatchable energy recourses, only the nondispatchable renewable energy resources (wind and solar energy) are considered to supply the required energy. Applied strategy for effective component size optimization as well as relevant costs reduction is implemented by reducing or eliminating the mismatch between the generation and consumption profiles by time shift and schedule of dispatchable loads. Furthermore, the effect of demand response utilization on loss of generated energy reduction is studied. The optimized results with and without demand response are extracted and compared to each other.
                  For each case, the optimum configuration was determined. Obtained results indicated that application of the demand response program, reduced the number of required batteries, the required inverter and photovoltaic cells capacity, and, consequently, the total net present costs. Furthermore, demand response implementation reduced the peak of consumed loads and increased the consumed load factor and correlation factor. The micro-grid components have been modeled mathematically within the framework of the mixed integer linear programming method. The optimization program has been performed by HOMER software together with GAMS software via the CPLEX solver.

Optimal Prediction Intervals of Wind Power Generation,
Role of power-to-gas in an integrated gas and electricity system in Great Britain,"
                  Power-to-gas (PtG) converts electricity into hydrogen using the electrolysis process and uses the gas grid for the storage and transport of hydrogen. Hydrogen is injected into a gas network in a quantity and quality compatible with the gas safety regulations and thereby transported as a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas to demand centres. Once integrated into the electricity network, PtG systems can provide flexibility to the power system and absorb excess electricity from renewables to produce hydrogen. Injection of hydrogen into the gas network reduces gas volumes supplied from terminals.
                  In order to investigate this concept, hydrogen electrolysers were included as a technology option within an operational optimisation model of the Great Britain (GB) combined gas and electricity network (CGEN). The model was used to determine the minimum cost of meeting the electricity and gas demand in a typical low and high electricity demand day in GB, in the presence of a significant capacity of wind generation. The value of employing power-to-gas systems in the gas and electricity supply system was investigated given different allowable levels of hydrogen injections. The results showed that producing hydrogen from electricity is capable of reducing wind curtailment in a high wind case and decreasing the overall cost of operating the GB gas and electricity network. The northern part of GB was identified as a suitable region to develop hydrogen electrolysis and injection facilities due to its vicinity to a significant capacity of wind generation, as well as the existence of gas network headroom capacity, which is expected to increase as a result of depletion of UK domestic gas resources.

Dealing with multiple decades of hourly wind and PV time series in energy models: A comparison of methods to reduce time resolution and the planning implications of inter-annual variability,"Using a high-resolution planning model of the Great Britain power system and 25years of simulated wind and PV generation data, this study compares different methods to reduce time resolution of energy models to increase their computational tractability: downsampling, clustering, and heuristics. By comparing model results in terms of costs and installed capacities across different methods, this study shows that the best method depends heavily on input data and the setup of model constraints. This implies that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the problem of time step reduction, but heuristic approaches appear promising. In addition, the 25years of time series demonstrate considerable inter-year variability in wind and PV power output. This further complicates the problem of time detail in energy models as it suggests long time series are necessary. Model results with high shares of PV and wind generation using a single or few years of data are likely unreliable. Better modeling and planning methods are required to determine robust scenarios with high shares of variable renewables. The methods are implemented in the freely available open-source modeling framework Calliope."
The merit-order effect in the Italian power market: The impact of solar and wind generation on national wholesale electricity prices,"
                  Italy promoted one of the most generous renewable support schemes worldwide which resulted in a high increase of solar power generation. We analyze the Italian day-ahead wholesale electricity market, finding empirical evidence of the merit-order effect. Over the period 2005–2013 an increase of 1GWh in the hourly average of daily production from solar and wind sources has, on average, reduced wholesale electricity prices by respectively 2.3€/MWh and 4.2€/MWh and has amplified their volatility. The impact on prices has decreased over time in correspondence with the increase in solar and wind electricity production. We estimate that, over the period 2009–2013, solar production has generated higher monetary savings than wind production, mainly because the former is more prominent than the latter. However, in the solar case, monetary savings are not sufficient to compensate the cost of the related supporting schemes which are entirely internalized within end-user tariffs, causing a reduction of the consumer surplus, while the opposite occurs in the case of wind.

Race to carbon neutrality in South Africa: What role does environmental technological innovation play?,"
                  Governments worldwide have prioritized carbon reduction and neutrality to address the escalating threat of climate change. These goals are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG-13). These goals stress taking action on climate change to lessen the bad effects of human activities and using fossil fuels for energy. To this end, the present study investigates the connection between conventional energy usage, agricultural practices, economic growth, and their impact on environmental sustainability in South Africa. Additionally, it explores the role of renewable energy consumption and environmental technological innovation in mitigating these effects. To achieve the study objectives, a carbon-income function is fitted with an annual frequency data from 1975 to 2020. The present study leverages on Pesaran's Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method and for robustness analysis the dynamic ARDL simulations method to simultaneously explore the short and long-run coefficients of the study's outlined variables. Empirical analysis, confirmed by bounds testing for cointegration, reveals a long-term equilibrium relationship among the variables considered. Notably, economic growth, fossil fuel energy consumption, and agricultural activities have adverse effects on environmental sustainability in South Africa, indicating a trade-off between economic growth and environmental quality. Dynamic ARDL simulations provide further evidence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) phenomenon. However, renewable energy consumption and environmental technological innovation positively influence environmental quality. These findings highlight the imperative for South Africa and its stakeholders to adopt green growth policies and transition to cleaner energy alternatives.

                  Environmental innovation is an integral part of sustainable development goal (SDG) 9. It also provides the foundation for green energy production, and thus, indirectly supports the accomplishment of SDG 7. Notably, the energy transition from fossil fuel to renewables is critical for achieving sustainable development and a cleaner environment. Therefore, this study explores the major driving forces of environmental innovation in 29 OECD countries from 1993 to 2019 by incorporating environmental taxation, carbon pricing policy, budget for renewable energy development and demonstration, regional authority, financial development, and globalization. The recently proposed Quantile via Movements methodology is employed to address the spiral dependence of explanatory variables and obtain results at different quantiles. The findings of Quantile via movements reveal that enhancing environmental taxation and strengthening carbon pricing policies encourage environmental innovation. Moreover, these countries should decentralize policymaking and delegate authority to regions. Alongside this, policymaking for encouraging the private sector budgets for renewable energy development and demonstration is necessary. The stringent policy regulations at the regional level can enhance the innovation of domestic industries concerning the development, adoption, and commercial competitiveness of environment-friendly technologies. Furthermore, the financial sector’s development enhances environmental innovation, while globalization needs to be properly regulated.

Enhancing resource efficiency through the utilization of the green bond market: An empirical analysis of Asian economies,"
                  This research explores the effects of the green bonds market on resource efficiency across 12 actively involved Asian economies from 2015 to 2022. The empirical results indicate a positive connection between green bond issuance and resource efficiency, suggesting that a 1% increase in green bonds corresponds to significant short-term (0.33%) and long-term (0.43%) improvements. Surprisingly, a negative relationship is observed between GDP growth and resource efficiency, implying that economic expansion may contribute to heightened resource consumption. The study highlights the favorable impact of renewable power generation on resource efficiency, driven by the sustainability of renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, challenges arise from poverty ratios and consumer price indices, impeding the adoption of resource-efficient technology. Furthermore, while cell phone penetration initially benefits resource efficiency, a negative correlation emerges in the long term due to increased non-renewable energy consumption. In light of these findings, the study recommends practical policies for sustainable development, including actively promoting the green bonds market, targeted investments in renewable energy, and initiatives to address economic disparities while encouraging resource-efficient practices.

The results show that 1) the leading PV enterprises have basically formed relatively stable internal collaborations and that the scale of innovation network development has expanded rapidly, with very strong stamina; 2) with the development of China's PV industry, many innovative PV techniques have been developed by leading enterprises in the field of innovation and research and development (R&D) of PV technology, and among patent applicants with strong collaboration, kinship collaboration with investment relationships is dominant; 3) provinces participating in PV technology innovation are increasing significantly, the network is more influenced by leading nodes, and the eastern coastal provinces are pioneers in the innovation and R&D of PV technology; and 4) PV technological innovation collaboration between patent applicants and cities has changed from local collaboration to cross-regional collaboration, high-value areas are basically concentrated in the eastern coastal region of China, with scattered spatial characteristics, and cross-regional collaboration presents a “triangular” spatial structure, with the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei as cores. The conclusions can provide patent information support for scientific research on energy conservation and emission reduction to achieve low-carbon goals, and can also provide reference for policy formulation of renewable energy development and green development strategies."
Recent advancement and assessment of green hydrogen production technologies,"
                  Hydrogen energy has garnered substantial support from industry, government, and the public, positioning it as a pivotal future fuel source. However, its commercial realisation faces significant hurdles, including slow infrastructure growth and the high cost of producing clean hydrogen. This review uniquely emphasises the different colour codes of hydrogen, which have been rarely discussed in the literature to date. Hydrogen production methods are classified by colour codes, with green hydrogen, produced from renewable sources such as wind and solar, being the most desirable option. The demand for green hydrogen across various sectors is expected to surge. This review comprehensively evaluates the major hydrogen production methods based on cost, environmental impact, and technological maturity. Recent data confirm the increased efficiency, cost-competitiveness, and scalability of green hydrogen production technologies. The cost of green hydrogen has declined significantly, making it competitive with blue hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels with carbon capture). The review also scrutinises several recent hydrogen production technologies, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and technological readiness. Among these, the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) currently outperforms others, with anion exchange membrane (AEM) and electrified steam methane reforming (ESMR) also showing promise. This review also succinctly summarises global progress in hydrogen infrastructure and policies. By spotlighting the diverse colour codes of hydrogen and discussing the crucial takeaways and implications for the future, this review offers a comprehensive overview of the hydrogen energy landscape. This unique focus enriches the literature and enhances our understanding of hydrogen as a promising energy source.

"Modeling the linkage between climate-tech, energy transition, and CO2 emissions: Do environmental regulations matter?","
                  The transition from conventional energy to clean energy is the ultimate strategy to reduce global CO2 emissions. In this regard, climate technologies (climate-tech) can pave the way toward achieving the capabilities required to promote alternative energy and energy saving. In addition, environmental regulations can support technological upgrading, energy transition, and emissions reduction to promote sustainable development. With this in view, this study investigates the impact of climate technologies (climate-tech) and energy transitions on CO2 emissions in the European Union (EU) member countries. Further, we examine the role of environmental regulation in the relationship between climate-tech, energy transition, and CO2 emissions. The empirical analysis is conducted based on international panel data for 26 EU countries ranging from 1994 to 2019, and the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCE-MG) method is employed to estimate the coefficients of the variables. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that both climate-tech and energy transitions mitigate environmental degradation by reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, environmental regulations are found to be an effective monitoring and controlling tool that can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Moreover, economic growth and urbanization as control variables contribute to increasing CO2 emissions, thus negatively affecting environmental sustainability. The causal analysis demonstrates that decision-making trends related to climate-tech, energy transition, and environmental regulations influence CO2 emissions. Conversely, strategies for coping with CO2 emissions and climate change will affect energy transitions and environmental regulations. In light of these analytical findings, this paper proposes that EU countries should vigorously develop climate-related green technologies and actively promote the energy transition process along with the implementation of environmental regulations for sustainable development.

A short review on generation of green fuel hydrogen through water splitting,"
                  Hydrogen is considered as a promising clean and renewable energy carrier and an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. A potential and cheapest way to produce hydrogen is involving water splitting either by light or electricity. The vital step involved in water splitting is the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which requires the use of an efficient catalyst to lower its large overpotential value. Therefore, the development of earth-abundant photocatalysts and electrocatalysts with high activity and long-term stability for hydrogen generation gains major attention. The present review summarizes the mechanism of hydrogen production via water splitting utilizing different metal-based and metal-free photocatalysts and electrocatalysts. Different strategies adopted to improve the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for water splitting are discussed. Finally, the challenges and future scope of hydrogen evolution reaction are briefly summarized.

Novel Pt-carbon core-shell decorated hierarchical CoMo2S4 as efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline/seawater hydrogen evolution reaction,"
                  Electrochemical water electrolysis is a prominent method of green-hydrogen fuel production. Tailored nanostructures of Pt-based electrocatalysts have high priority in hydrogen production. Herein, we fabricated carbon-encapsulated Pt core–shell supported CoMo2S4-NGNF as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The novel carbon-encapsulated Pt core shells improved the long-term durability. The Pt@CoMo2S4-NGNF hybrids displayed overpotentials of 27 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2
                     in 1.0 M KOH and outstanding durability of 100 h. When Pt@CoMo2S4-NGNF∥IrO2 was employed in overall seawater electrolysis applications, it required 1.54 V to achieve a 10 mA cm−2
                     current density. Additionally, we evaluated the electronic structure and HER mechanism of Pt@CoMo2S4 & CoMo2S4 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work illustrates the possibility of designing an effective, long-lasting, and scalable electrocatalyst for the electrolysis of alkaline and seawater to produce pure hydrogen.

Photocatalytic H2O2 production Systems: Design strategies and environmental applications,"
                  Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly versatile oxidant, which has been used in chemical industry, medical, energy, and environmental fields. Photocatalytic H2O2 production is a sustainable, safe, and green process; however, the high recombination of electron-hole pairs, low visible light utilization, and poor product selectivity still limit the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 production. Previous reviews on photocatalytic H2O2 generation focus more on the photocatalysts but less on the design strategy of the photocatalytic systems, which stems from the critical steps involving the photocatalytic process, i.e., light absorption, charge separation, and surface redox reaction. From this point of review, this review article introduces the strategies for improving the H2O2 production efficiency based on the above three critical processes. Moreover, the environmental applications of photocatalytic H2O2 generation including disinfection and pollutant degradation are discussed. The challenges and prospects in photocatalytic H2O2 production and its future environmental applications are also envisioned.

"Electrocatalytic seawater splitting: Nice designs, advanced strategies, challenges and perspectives","
                  H2 has a sufficiently high energy density and a combustion process that emits no carbon, therefore being an appealing storable alternative to fossil fuels. With evident advantages of seawater resources available worldwide, electrochemically making H2 from seawater holds a great development prospect towards the global deployment of H2-based energy plants. However, with current water splitting technologies, this is not an easy task, and the primary obstacle is impurities in natural seawater including halide salts, magnesium salts, organic matter, etc., which readily cause the electrocatalysis systems to shut down. We herein present a timely review of seawater electrolysis systems at both lab-scale fundamental research and pilot-scale reactor level on the basis of most representative studies. We analyze some of the crucial experimental details that are frequently ignored, such as seawater treatments, product detection, electrode assembly, reactors, electrolyte feeding modes, etc. We then systematically emphasize the latest and representative strategies and catalytic materials designs as well as whether corresponding electrodes are genuinely stable as two key quests to find out truly reliable and exploitable electrode engineering. Gas release behaviors/kinetics at high reaction rates are highlighted as well. In addition, we introduce valuable contents like how to learn from ocean life for electrocatalytic system design. We conclude by taking a look at the future research directions and opportunities for encouraging more practical applications of seawater electrolysis systems/technologies.

Strategies to save energy in the context of the energy crisis: a review,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>New technologies, systems, societal organization and policies for energy saving are urgently needed in the context of accelerated climate change, the Ukraine conflict and the past coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects. The global energy consumption in 2020 was 30.01% for the industry, 26.18% for transport, and 22.08% for residential sectors. 10–40% of energy consumption can be reduced using renewable energy sources, passive design strategies, smart grid analytics, energy-efficient building systems, and intelligent energy monitoring. Electric vehicles offer the highest cost-per-kilometer reduction of 75% and the lowest energy loss of 33%, yet battery-related issues, cost, and weight are challenging. 5–30% of energy can be saved using automated and networked vehicles. Artificial intelligence shows a huge potential in energy saving by improving weather forecasting and machine maintenance and enabling connectivity across homes, workplaces, and transportation. For instance, 18.97–42.60% of energy consumption can be reduced in buildings through deep neural networking. In the electricity sector, artificial intelligence can automate power generation, distribution, and transmission operations, balance the grid without human intervention, enable lightning-speed trading and arbitrage decisions at scale, and eliminate the need for manual adjustments by end-users.</jats:p>"

Highly efficient adsorption and removal bio-staining dye from industrial wastewater onto mesoporous Ag-MOFs,"
                  Adsorption is an effective and promising approach for removing pollutants from wastewater. Too many hazardous colors were unintentionally released into the water, which had a negative impact on the environment. A popular textile dye is malachite green (MG). Thus, in this work, an environmentally acceptable inorganic-organic Ag metal-organic framework-based technique to remove colors from industrial water was developed (Ag-MOF). The sorbent was analyzed in the first section of the work using SEM, XPS, XRD, FT-IR, pHpzc, and BET, which confirmed that the Ag-MOF had the BET surface area, is 676 m2/g, which is a significant surface area. In a later stage, the sorption properties of the dye were examined along with the effects of pH, sorbent dosage, temperature, and ionic strength; the sorption isotherms and uptake kinetics were examined: As opposed to the kinetic profile, Isotherm profiles are well-fit by the Langmuir equation and can be modeled by the pseudo-second order rate equation. The outcomes further demonstrated that MG was mostly adsorbed onto Ag-MOF adsorbent by electrostatic attraction forces, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange, and pore filling. 2.25 mmol/g was found to be the greatest adsorption effectiveness of MG onto Ag-MOF adsorbent. (i.e. 809.71 mg/g). Adsorbent dosage, solution pH, temperature, and time were the four adsorption process parameters that were tuned using Box-Behnken design (BBD) in response surface methodology (RSM). The (ΔH°), (ΔS°), and (ΔG°) MG dye was endothermically and spontaneously extracted using Ag-MOF as an adsorbent, according to the specifications. Up to five cycles of adsorption-desorption, the synthesised Ag-MOF adsorbent demonstrates exceptional render ability and cyclability. The produced adsorbent's efficacy for purifying wastewater samples at a laboratory scale was assessed as a proof of concept. Study the mechanism of interaction between the Ag-MOF and MG as it could be take place through π-π interaction, pore filling, H-Bonding or electrostatic interaction. The mesoporous Ag-MOF adsorbent offered a simple and effective way to handle water filtering and industrial wastewater management. According to our research, this work is the first to explain how to remove MG dye from wastewater samples using Ag-MOF adsorbents.

"Environmental impact of renewable energy source based electrical power plants: Solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, tidal, ocean, and osmotic","
                  Renewable energy source (RES) based electrical power plants are widely considered green and clean due to their contribution to decarbonizing the energy sectors. It is apparent that RESs do not produce carbon dioxide, however their significant negative impacts on the environment are still found and cannot be ignored. In this paper, the environmental impacts of RES based power plants are analyzed through a comprehensive review considering solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, tidal, ocean current, oceanic wave, ocean thermal, and osmotic effects. Solar thermal power is well known as concentrated solar power. A strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis is carried out and discussed for all RES based power plants. Comparative SWOT analyses for solar photovoltaic and concentrated solar power plants are presented. The comparative environmental impact analyses for all existing RES based power plants are tabulated for various attributes. These attributes include but are not limited to human health, noise, pollution, greenhouse gas emission, ozone layer depletion, toxification, flooding, impact on inhabitants, eutrophication, dried up rivers, and deforestation. Based on the analysis, it is found that careful selection of RES for electrical power plants is necessary because improper utilization of RES could be very harmful for the environment.

The economics and the environmental benignity of different colors of hydrogen,"Due to the increasing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as due to the rapidly increasing use of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation over the last years, interest in hydrogen is rising again. Hydrogen can be used as a storage for renewable energy balancing the whole energy systems, and contributing to the decarbonization of the energy system, especially of the industry and the transport sector. The major objective of this paper is to discuss various ways of hydrogen production depending on the primary energy sources used. Moreover, the economic and environmental performance of three major hydrogen colors, as well as major barriers for faster deployment in fuel cell vehicles, are analyzed. The major conclusion is that the full environmental benefits of hydrogen use are highly dependent on the hydrogen production methods and primary sources used. Only green hydrogen with electricity from wind, PV and hydro has truly low emissions. All other sources like blue hydrogen with CCUS or electrolysis using the electricity grid have substantially higher emissions, coming close to grey hydrogen production. Another conclusion is that it is important to introduce an international market for hydrogen to lower costs and to produce hydrogen where conditions are best. Finally, the major open question remaining is whether – including all external costs of all energy carriers, hydrogen of any color may become economically competitive in any sector of the energy system. The future success of hydrogen is very dependent on technological development and resulting cost reductions, as well as on future priorities and the corresponding policy framework. The policy framework should support the shift from grey to green hydrogen."
Optimal economic scheduling of microgrids considering renewable energy sources based on energy hub model using demand response and improved water wave optimization algorithm,"
                  Unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources puts power system operators in different conditions in terms of maintaining the system reliability. Microgrids (MGs) can provide an effective solution for the problems of grid-connected renewable energy sources due to their tuning capability and flexibility. In this study, a stochastic optimization strategy was proposed for participating in energy market operations considering demand response (DR). The results indicated the operating cost decreased when the MG implemented DR programs. Also, DR program could shift energy consumption from on- to off-peak hours and flatten the load curve. Therefore, a scheduling model was presented for the operation of energy carriers and reserves considering security constraints of power and natural gas grids in interconnected hubs as well as responsive load participation using the developed water wave optimization (WWO) algorithm. The objective function of this model aimed to minimize the operating cost of sources to supply electrical and thermal loads applied to the proposed MG. WWO is a meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the behavior of water waves. The waves formed on the sea surface have complex, but interesting, relationships that can be used to solve optimization problems. In this algorithm, each problem solution is encoded as a water wave and undergoes changes in the problem search space based on three behaviors of propagation, refraction, and decay of water waves or problem solutions. The simplicity of the structure of this method, elitism and the ability to escape from local points due to the existence of different search operators and the mutation of generations have led to the use of this method. The results indicated a decline in operating costs through electrical and thermal responsive load participation and thermal energy storage system. Results of the proposed model revealed a correlation between the electricity price and natural gas consumption, indicating multi-carrier energy grids should be examined and optimized simultaneously.

Semi-supervised adversarial discriminative learning approach for intelligent fault diagnosis of wind turbine,"
                  Wind turbines play a crucial role in renewable energy generation systems and are frequently exposed to challenging operational environments. Monitoring and diagnosing potential faults during their operation is essential for improving reliability and reducing maintenance costs. Supervised learning using data-driven techniques, particularly deep learning, offers a viable approach for developing fault diagnosis models. However, a significant challenge in practical wind power equipment lies in the scarcity of annotated samples required to train these models effectively. This paper proposes a semi-supervised fault diagnosis approach specifically designed for wind turbines, aiming to address this challenge. Initially, a semi-supervised deep neural network is constructed using adversarial learning, where a limited set of annotated samples is used in conjunction with a vast amount of unannotated samples. The health status features present in the unannotated samples are leveraged to capture a generalized representation of the underlying features. Subsequently, a metric learning-guided discriminative features enhancement technique is employed to improve the separability of different manifolds, thereby enhancing the performance of the semi-supervised training process. By employing this methodology, it becomes possible to develop a fault diagnosis model with superior accuracy using only a limited amount of annotated samples. Comprehensive fault diagnosis experiments were conducted on a wind turbine fault dataset, revealing the efficacy and superiority of the presented methodology.

                  This research introduces a stochastic scheduling approach that incorporates risk constraints for an energy hub (EH), considering uncertainties related to renewable generation and load demands. The proposed method utilizes the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) technique to assess and quantify risks. By striking a balance between reducing operational and emissions costs and increasing risk aversion, the approach presents a trade-off. The EH comprises various components such as a wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV) cells, a fuel cell power plant (FCPP), a combined heat and power generation unit (CHP), and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Uncertain variables encompass factors such as wind speed, solar irradiation, different demands, and market prices. To optimize profits and enhance the consumption curve, demand response programs (DRPs) for electrical, thermal, and cooling demands are implemented. To address the uncertainties associated with input random variables, the efficient k-means data clustering method is employed. A new slime mold algorithm, based on coughing and chaos theory, has been proposed to enhance the problem's solution. The algorithm incorporates innovative operators to improve its capabilities. By utilizing the coughing mechanism and chaos theory, the algorithm explores the solution space more effectively, resulting in improved outcomes for the problem at hand. The results demonstrate significant flexibility in EH management and are extensively discussed. Simulation results indicate that integrating PEVs, FCPP, and DRPs can lead to reductions of 2 %, 7 %, and 11 % in the EH's operating costs, respectively. Furthermore, considering PEVs, FCPP, and DRPs can improve the EH's risk cost by 1.98 %, 6.7 %, and 10.5 %, respectively. Based on the numerical results, in Case 4 led to a remarkable 12.65 % reduction in operational costs while simultaneously achieving a 15.43 % decrease in emission costs, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in optimizing energy management in an energy hub system.
